    "advisory_text": "U.S. Embassy Kabul \n  U.S. Embassy Kabul suspended operations on August 31, 2021. \n Email:  AfghanistanACS@state.gov \n\nSee the Department of State’s  Fact Sheet on Afghanistan  for information on U.S.-Afghanistan relations.\nOn August 31, 2021, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan suspended all operations. Please read the  Travel Advisory  for Afghanistan, which advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan for any reason due to terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping and crime, and advises U.S. citizens currently in Afghanistan to depart immediately via commercial means if possible.\nU.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S. passport number, to  AfghanistanACS@state.gov .\nPassport and Visas:  U.S. citizens must have a valid passport and Afghan visa to enter and exit Afghanistan. Travelers arriving without a valid visa are subject to deportation, confiscation of their passport, heavy fines, or detention.  \nDual Nationals/Afghan Heritage:  U.S. citizens born in Afghanistan of Afghan parentage are considered to be Afghan nationals and are not required to have an entry visa. U.S. citizens of Afghan parentage who were not born in Afghanistan must have a visa to enter Afghanistan.\nRegistration:  Foreigners arriving in Afghanistan are fingerprinted during the immigration process. Foreign passengers arriving at the Kabul International Airport are expected to register with a representative of the Ministry of Interior’s Foreigners’ Registration Office. If the airport office is closed, registration may take place at the Ministry of Interior’s Kabul Statistics Office located at Kart-e-Parwan Square in front of Nadirya High School. Registrants will receive a registration card .  The registration card must be surrendered upon the foreign national’s departure from Afghanistan.\nMedical Requirements:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents of Afghanistan.\nPlease visit the Consular Affairs website for information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations .\nThe security situation is extremely unstable and the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. No province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. U.S. citizens who do decide to go to Afghanistan should maintain a low profile and exercise extreme discretion in disclosing their movement plans and personal information.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nDecades of disorder and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terrorism. U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals are primary targets of terrorist organizations. Violent extremist groups across Afghanistan continue to utilize a variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a public perception of instability. Such tactics include the use of attackers laden with suicide vests, vehicle-borne explosive devices, magnetic explosive devices, indirect fire (rockets and mortars), and direct fire (shootings and rocket propelled grenades). Local security forces, buildings housing ministries and other public sector institutions, foreign embassies, non-government organization offices, and soft targets, such as hotels, markets, schools, hospitals, and public gatherings, are common attack targets. Kabul has been and remains a high-profile location for large-scale terror attacks, as successful operations in the capital tend to generate media coverage. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should familiarize themselves with their residential compound or hotel’s emergency planning and rehearse the steps they would take if the venue were to come under attack.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nKidnapping/Hostage Taking/Wrongful Detention : Violent extremist groups and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals, specifically U.S. citizens, in Afghanistan, including journalists, aid workers, teachers, medical professionals, and individuals associated with international and non-governmental organizations. Criminal groups in Afghanistan will target any individual perceived to have money for kidnapping and/or extortion. Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates may also sell their captives to terrorist groups, with victims potentially spending years in captivity. Additionally, the threat of wrongful detention remains high as U.S. citizens have been detained and held for indefinite periods in Afghanistan under unclear or unjust circumstances.\nDemonstrations and Riots : U.S. citizens should avoid all rallies and demonstrations, as even events intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence with little warning. Public gatherings and demonstrations have also been the targets of terrorist attacks.\nProperty/Business Disputes:  Afghan-Americans returning to Afghanistan to recover property often become involved in complicated real estate disputes. Some have involved threats of retaliatory action, including kidnapping, and assassinations. Similarly, U.S. citizens involved in business or commercial disputes have been threatened with detention and imprisonment, and had their property seized to use as collateral. U.S. citizens have reported being physically attacked and family members have also been harmed as the result of such disputes. U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that either local law enforcement or the U.S. government will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes. Hiring a private attorney, early in the dispute, especially one who can act on behalf of the U.S. citizen in their absence, is recommended.\nCommunications:  Large parts of Afghanistan are extremely isolated and landline telephone communications remain limited. Cell phone service is unpredictable, and areas outside major urban centers suffer from irregular and weak signals. U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should always carry backup communications such as satellite phones or handheld radios, along with a vehicle/personal tracking device.\nCrime:  Afghanistan is considered a critical threat environment for crime. Criminal organizations, including weapons and narcotics traffickers, undermine peace and stability throughout the country. Common petty or street crime exists, primarily in cities. Transient populations and internally displaced peoples may contribute to crime and lawlessness.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. Embassy Kabul suspended operations on August 31, 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide any routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, including victims of crime.\nLocal authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes committed in Afghanistan. The local equivalent to the U.S. “911” emergency line is “119” in Afghanistan. Please note that local operators do not speak English and that emergency services are restricted to the major cities. The emergency line may not be answered, and response times are usually longer than in the United States.\nTravelers should not expect or rely on significant assistance from local authorities in Afghanistan in resolving legal disputes. This is especially true for U.S.-based companies and their employees seeking local protection from extralegal efforts to resolve contract disputes. Property may be seized, and personnel may be detained as collateral pending the resolution of such disputes.\nVisit our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas  for additional details.\nTourism:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response services and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are very limited in-Afghanistan and may be entirely unavailable outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance that covers medical evacuation from Afghanistan. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are subject to Afghan laws. A U.S. passport will not help you avoid detention or prosecution and may result in heightened attention by police and prosecutors, some of whom may seek to exploit your status as a U.S. citizen for financial or political gain. Persons violating Afghan laws, even unknowingly, may be fined, detained, imprisoned, or possibly executed. Penalties in Afghanistan can be more severe than for similar offenses in the United States. U.S. citizens may face the death penalty for crimes that would not be punishable by death in the United States.\nCertain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States, whether or not they are illegal under the local law. Withholding someone's identity documents, such as passports, green cards, or tazkeras, knowing that they are necessary for travel, can lead to criminal prosecution in the United States. For additional examples, see our page on  crimes against minors abroad  and visit the website of the  U.S. Department of Justice .\nReligion and Islam:  Islam, along with tribal law and customs (e.g.,  pashtunwali  in predominately Pashtun areas), provides a foundation for Afghans’ lived experiences. The influence of tribal law and customs are greater in Afghanistan’s rural sector, compared to urban areas. Foreign visitors are expected to remain sensitive to Afghanistan’s Islamic and local cultures, and not dress in revealing or provocative manners, including the wearing of sleeveless shirts and blouses, halter-tops, and/or shorts.\nProselytizing may be deemed an insult to Islam, and could result in severe punishments including – but not limited to – incarceration, and the death penalty. Committing a blasphemous act or producing or distributing material deemed critical of Islam is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty. Apostasy may carry a maximum penalty of death for Muslims who denounce Islam or convert to another religion. Allegations of conversion of Afghan citizens are taken particularly seriously. Accusations of blasphemy or insulting Islam, even when unproven, have led to deadly mob violence.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also have to pay fines and/or give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice’s website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nFinancial Debts:  U.S. citizens in Afghanistan have been detained in cases involving financial debts and contract disputes, as these disputes are generally considered criminal matters in Afghanistan. Hiring a local attorney in the early stages of such a dispute is recommended.\nWomen Travelers:  Afghanistan is a traditional country, particularly when it comes to roles and behavior. To help maintain a low profile, women should ensure their shirts cover their full arms, collarbone, and waistband, and their pants/skirts cover their ankles, especially when traveling outside Kabul. Almost all women in Afghanistan cover their hair in public; female travelers are advised to carry scarves for this purpose. Women are expected to be escorted by a male relative and can be detained for traveling alone. Women visiting Afghanistan should be alert of the risk of sexual assault and are recommended to review the Department of State’s travel tips for  women travelers .\nLGB Travelers:  The Taliban consider consensual same-sex sexual activity to be a criminal offense, and representatives routinely enforced this position through violence, intimidation, harassment, and targeted killings. Conviction for same-sex sexual conduct is punishable by death, flogging, or imprisonment. Individual Taliban members made public statements reiterating that their interpretation of sharia includes the death penalty for homosexuality. LGB individuals face discrimination, violence, and persecution in Afghan society. See our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nForced Marriage:  The Department is aware of cases involving U.S. citizen women of Afghan heritage who have been convinced by their families to travel to Afghanistan, usually under the guise of visiting relatives, only to find themselves forced into marriage. The U.S. government considers forced marriage to be a human rights abuse and, in the case of minors, a form of child abuse. Forced marriage is defined as one in which one or both parties have not consented to the marriage (or are incapable of providing meaningful consent) and differs from arranged marriage. Often, victims of forced marriage are subjected to non-consensual sex, physical and emotional abuse, and isolation. Individuals who refuse a forced marriage may be threatened with violence or with being disowned by their families, who also often confiscate their belongings (including passports).\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Afghan law protects the rights of persons with disabilities, but the provisions are not implemented in practice. Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, and hotels, and few communication accommodations. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators.\nBanking:  Access to banking facilities in Afghanistan is limited and unreliable. The economy generally operates on a cash-only basis, though the use of credit cards is becoming more common in larger cities. ATMs are available in major cities, but U.S. banks often deny transactions from Afghanistan unless a traveler provides advanced notice of the transaction.\nCustoms:  Afghan customs authorities generally enforce strict regulations on the import/export of certain goods such as alcoholic beverages, religious materials, antiquities, medication, precious stones and metals, and printed materials. U.S. citizen travelers have faced fines and/or confiscation of items considered antiquities upon exiting Afghanistan.\nWeapons/Firearms:  U.S. citizens, including security contractors and military personnel, should carefully review Afghan import/export restrictions on weapons, firearms, and ammunition, including antique or display models. It is also important to review the regulations of any country through which you may transit, as many countries have strict rules prohibiting these items, even in checked luggage. Consult the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  for information on traveling with such items into or out of the United States.\nFor emergency services in Afghanistan, dial 119 or 100 for police; 102 for medical assistance; 112 for fire.\nAmbulance services are:\nInjured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nBasic medical care is available in major Afghan cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities vary in quality and range of services and are generally below U.S. standards. Doctors and hospitals often require cash prepayment for services. Western-style private clinics can be found in Kabul offering a variety of basic emergency and routine preventative-type care, but their hours are limited, and such facilities may not be suitable for complex trauma cases or severe medical emergencies. Individuals without licenses or medical degrees sometimes operate private clinics, and there is no public agency that monitors their operations.\nTravelers are strongly urged to obtain sufficient supplies of prescription and commonly used over-the-counter medications prior to arrival. Many U.S.-brand medications are not available in Afghanistan. Travelers should be aware that many pharmaceuticals found in Afghanistan are counterfeits, and the quality of locally produced medications is uneven.\nThe U.S. government does not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  Travelers’ Health webpage  and general  Traveler Advice  for Afghanistan.\nWater Quality & Food Safety:  In many areas of Afghanistan, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\nInsurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan will cover you outside of the United States, and that it specifically covers care when you are in Afghanistan. U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not provide coverage overseas. Many insurance companies consider Afghanistan to be an active warzone and specifically exclude coverage for individuals residing or traveling there.\nU.S. citizens are strongly recommended to obtain  supplemental medical evacuation insurance  as medical transport out of Afghanistan can be prohibitively expensive. When selecting a medical evacuation provider, be sure to confirm that the company offers such services in Afghanistan and obtain a list of clinics and hospitals that may be used as a medical evacuation point. Please note that the U.S. government   cannot pay your medical bills.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nTraffic Safety and Road Conditions:  Road conditions in Afghanistan are generally poor. Many urban streets in Afghanistan have large potholes and are not well lit, and rural roads are frequently not paved. There have also been reports of cave-ins and erosion on the Ring Road (the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat-Mazar highway). Vehicles are often poorly maintained and overloaded. Traffic laws are often not enforced, and roadside assistance is non-existent. Vehicular traffic is chaotic, and drivers must contend with numerous pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals. With congested roads, non-standard traffic patterns, and abundant pedestrian traffic, vehicle accidents are a serious concern and can escalate into violent confrontations . All drivers are urged to drive defensively, drive only in the daylight, and pay close attention to their surroundings. Owners of vehicles with tinted windows can be detained. Please see our information on  Road Safety .\nU.S. citizens should also be aware that land mines and large quantities of unexploded ordnance exist throughout the countryside and along roads, posing a danger to travelers. Robberies and kidnappings are also prevalent on the roads outside Kabul.\nAviation Safety Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Afghanistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Afghanistan, the FAA has issued a Notice to Airmen ( NOTAM ) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation ( SFAR ). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the  Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices ."

Passengers wishing to visit certain cities of the south may qualify for a visa on arrival if this is organized by an approved travel agency.  All other travelers must obtain a visa from an Algerian embassy or consulate in advance of travel. If you have Israeli entry stamps in your passport, you may experience difficulties.\nDual Nationality:  The Algerian government treats dual-national Algerian-Americans who enter Algeria on an Algerian passport solely as Algerian citizens. U.S. citizen women married to Algerians do not require the husband’s authorization to depart. Dual-national minor children exiting Algeria on an Algerian passport with just one parent will need to provide the Algerian family book (livret de famille) in order to demonstrate the relationship between the child and the accompanying parent.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Algeria.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists use simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds.  They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nTerrorist Activity:  Algeria has long been an important counterterrorism partner to the United States. It continues its aggressive campaign to eliminate all terrorist activity. However, active terrorist threats remain in Algeria and along its borders. In 2024, the Algeria reported nearly 53 counter-terrorism operations. These resulted in nine terrorists captured and 10 hideouts discovered and destroyed. Over the past five years, Algeria reported 24 major attacks. Almost all these terrorist attacks targeted Algerian security forces. Almost all involved improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or ambush tactics as suspects actively fled through rural mountainous regions.\nWe warn U.S. citizens against travel to remote areas in southern and eastern Algeria. This is due to a high threat of terrorist attacks and kidnapping. As noted in our  Travel Advisories for Algeria , U.S. citizens should:\nActive terrorist groups in Algeria include Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Individuals who are inspired by and loyal to Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) are also active. These groups typically target Algerian government interests and security forces outside of major cities and mainly in mountainous and remote areas, but still aspire to target Western interests. Successful Algerian counterterrorism operations have limited AQIM, AQIM-allied groups, and ISIS capabilities.\nRecent incidents include:\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:  Algeria’s crime rate is moderate. Algeria has a very visible police presence throughout the country. Many plain-clothes police officers also exist. Petty theft and home burglary occur frequently in low-income areas. They also occur occasionally in affluent areas. Theft of contents and parts from parked cars, on trains and buses, and in hotel rooms occurs. Pickpocketing and purse snatching also occurs. In general, women face harassment in public if not accompanied by a male. Foreign women attract greater unwanted attention in public. International hotels generally provide adequate security.\nWe have seen several cases in which U.S. citizen women meet an Algerian man online. They are then lured to Algeria for marriage and held against their will in abusive situations.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Algeria. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.\nTips to avoid scammers:\nCommon scams include:\nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.\nGPS navigation apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.\nBe careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are. Meet in a popular public place. Avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at (213) 770-08-2000. The crime emergency lines in Algeria are 1548 and 17; for gendarmes, call 1055.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage. Staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, you may be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. This includes for laws you may not be aware of. Get information from the local authorities before you start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  website and  U.S. Department of Justice  website for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:\nSee the following webpages for details:\nInternational Volunteers:\nLGB Travelers:\nAlgerian law criminalizes so-called acts against nature. It also criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual acts between adult men and women. The law includes imprisonment of six months to three years and a fine of DZD 1,000 to DZD 10,000 ($8 to $80). The law also includes imprisonment of two months to two years and fines of DZD 500 to DZD 2,000 ($4 to $16) for committing a “homosexual act.” If a minor is involved, the adult may face up to three years’ imprisonment and a fine of DZD 10,000 ($80).\nLGB activists reported sweeping accusations that resulted in multiple arrests for consensual same-sex sexual relations. The arrests were permitted under the vague wording of laws criminalizing “homosexual acts” and so-called acts against nature. However, there were no known prosecutions during the past year. LGB status is not criminalized. However, LGB persons may face prosecution under laws disproportionately applied against LGB individuals. These typically concern prostitution, public indecency, and “associating with bad characters”. NGOs report that judges give harsher sentences to LGB persons compared to non-LGB persons.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Algeria prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public, however, is not as common as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation and lodging. It is also limited in communication/information, and general infrastructure. There is a significant difference between large cities and the rest of the country. \nAvailability of rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices is severely limited. Service providers, like sign language interpreters or personal assistants, are also severely limited. \nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Women walking along the streets in Algeria may experience sexual harassment from passing motorists and pedestrians. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nTravel within Algeria:  Non-Algerian employees of foreign companies or organizations based in Algeria must contact the Ministry of the Interior, Foreigners Office, before engaging in travel within the interior of the country. The Ministry will notify local police of the planned travel. The police may choose to assign escorts for that travel.\nMarriage in Algeria:  See our  Marriage in Algeria page  for documents that must be obtained before leaving the United States. \nDisaster Preparedness:  Algeria is a seismically active country. Earthquakes regularly occur throughout the country. Make contingency plans for your travel in Algeria. Leave emergency contact information with family members outside of Algeria. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available from the  U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  and at  Ready.gov .\nCurrency:  Algeria is a cash society. Most credit cards are not accepted outside of hotels. You must declare upon entry at Customs if you are traveling with more than 3000 Algerian dinar. You must also declare foreign currency that exceeds 1000 Euros (or the equivalent, approx. 1,100 USD). You can take up to 7500 Euros (or equivalent in other foreign currency, approx. 8,300 USD) out of the country. Proof that you withdrew the money from an Algerian bank account is required. Non-residents cannot take any amount of Algerian currency outside of the country. Algerian residents can take up 10,000 DA out of the country. Algerian dual-nationals who are not residents cannot exit with Algerian currency.\nThe official exchange rate may vary considerably from the actual exchange rate on the street. It is illegal to change money on the black market. You should only exchange foreign currency at banks or authorized currency exchange locations, such as major hotels. \nUpon leaving Algeria, authorities may ask if you have any currency and possibly search you. Penalties can be severe if you failed to declare foreign currency above the allowed amount upon entering Algeria but are found to possess it when exiting the country. They will compare the amount of foreign currency you declared when entering and the amount you are taking out. You will need to show documentation that your currency was exchanged legally.\nFor emergency services in Algeria, dial 021711414.\nAmbulance services are available in major cities such as the capital city of Algiers, but training and availability of emergency responders varies and may be below U.S. standards. Ambulance services are also not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment.  Response times are unpredictable and not as rapid as in the U.S. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nWe highly recommend you review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  Travelers’ Health webpage  and general  Traveler Advice  for Algeria.\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Credit card payment is not usually available. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment at time of services rendered\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See  our webpage  for more information on overseas insurance coverage.  Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nVaccinations:   Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.  The air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  It is typically at its worst in the summer. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals .  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities:  Adequate health facilities are available in Algiers and other major cities, but quality is variable. Health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. Medical staff may speak little or no English.\nGenerally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight in non-emergency wards. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.\nPsychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care primarily available through government institutions\nPharmaceuticals:\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:\nWater Quality:  Tap water is often not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Be aware that many places serve tap water unless bottled water is requested. Ice for drinks may be made with tap water.\nAdventure Travel:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Algeria suffers significant road safety problems, including poorly maintained roads, a lack of roadway signage, insufficient vehicle maintenance, defective and pirated auto parts, driver fatigue, and reckless and unskilled drivers. Lack of enforcement continues to be a major problem. While emergency response resources are adequate in Algiers and other populated cities, this is not the case in rural areas.\nTraffic Laws:   Driving in Algeria can be chaotic and unsafe.  There are limited traffic signs, very few designated lanes, and drivers often straddle two lanes when there are designated lanes.  There are very few sidewalks and pedestrians must often walk in the street.  When driving, ensure that you carry your state license and International Driver License.  In case of a traffic accident, contact the police and do not move vehicles until a police officer arrives.  Ensure that you get the other driver’s insurance information and identification as well.  \nPublic Transportation:  Trains operate between cities in the coastal regions of Algeria (although not inter-country). They are generally safe and reliable. There is a new urban railway in Algiers that runs along the coast and is clean and well-policed. Due to concerns about crime and mechanical safety, citizens should carefully consider the risks of buses, as well as taxis hailed on the street. There are new radio-dispatch taxis within Algiers as well as taxi hailing apps such as “Yassir” and “Heetch”.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Algeria, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Algeria’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Algeria should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .  Information may also be posted to the   U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

U.S. citizens should avoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness at all times.\nLandmines are a risk throughout the country outside major cities.\nCrime:  Armed assailants have killed some victims of muggings, robberies, and car-jackings, which occur frequently in all areas of the country. In fall 2019, a rash of violent robberies ended in homicides in Luanda.  The most commonly used tactic involves two individuals on a motorcycle who follow their victim to rob, usually at gunpoint. Criminals also target women by themselves, driving or walking. Lastly, motorcycles staging an accident is a tactic used to get you to stop and to lure you out of your vehicle or allow the criminals to enter your vehicle allegedly to take them to the hospital. Vehicle thefts, purse snatching, and theft from vehicles occur in areas frequented by foreigners.\nSee the  Department of State   and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Angola is 111: for police it’s 113; for firefighters, 115; and for ambulance services, 112.

For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad   and the  Department of Justice  website.\nPhotography:  It is illegal to take pictures or use binoculars, maps, or GPS near government buildings, military installations, and key infrastructure.  Angolan law defines key infrastructure broadly, to include historic or abandoned train stations or airfields, and bridges of any dimension. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of people without their permission.\nLibel Laws/Slander:  Disrespecting government officials is illegal and can lead to expulsion from the country. Angolan authorities confiscated the U.S. passports of a family for several weeks after they complained to immigration officials about the time it took to process their visas and passports at the airport.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nEmployment:  Angolan companies often have trouble transferring funds to foreign bank accounts, which can delay payments to foreign employees.\nPhone Service:  Cell phones are the norm, as landlines are non-existent. It is possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone. The major cellular providers are Angola Movicel, Africell, and Unitel.\nCurrency:  The kwanza (AOA) is the official currency, athough U.S. dollars are accepted in some situations. Bills should be new and unblemished. Local ATMs ( multicaixas ) only dispense kwanzas and frequently malfunction or run out of cash. While U.S. debit cards can sometimes be used to withdraw local currency at ATMs, there is a low daily limit of around 100,000 kwanzas (with a per-transaction limit of around 40,000). Aside from a handful of major, international hotels in Luanda, American or international credit cards are rarely accepted. It is recommended to bring a sufficient amount of cash to cover your trip and any emergency services (medical, roadside, etc.) that could occur.\nCurrency Regulations:\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on LGB conduct or identity, nor on the organization of LGB events in Angola, but, societal biases against LGB persons does sometimes result in discrimination, violence and/or abuse. Same-sex couples have been harassed and, in recent years, LGB foreigners have been the victims of harassment, assault, and homicide. Foreigners should be cautious prior to meeting someone from an online dating application. See our  LGB  Travel Information page and Section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Major hotels in Luanda have ramps.  Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations, particularly outside the capital.

Most rape cases are not prosecuted. Domestic violence counseling centers, shelters, and various treatment centers and free legal assistance are available to abused women.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nMedical facilities and services, including emergency care, are severely limited outside of Luanda and do not meet U.S. standards. In the capital, some private clinics offer modern medical equipment, internationally trained staff, and 24-hour emergency services including ambulances, but quality and consistency of medical care varies greatly. These clinics typically require pre-payment before admission and do not accept international credit cards or private medical insurance.  We do not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas and U.S. embassies and consulates do not cover medical bills.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.

Drunk driving is also a problem. Other hazards include potholes, lack of or attention to traffic signals, erratic driving habits, poorly maintained vehicles without headlights/taillights/brake lights, excessive speed, pedestrians, and roaming animals. During the rainy season, November-April, roads and bridges that are already in poor condition can become impassable and landmines may become displaced and surface outside known mine fields.\nWhen driving outside of Luanda on other than primary roads between major cities, a four-wheel-drive vehicle is useful. Secondary roads are often unpaved and nearly impassable. Major routes are paved in most areas and feature gas stations and other roadside services. Driving during daylight hours is recommended outside Luanda.\nTraffic Laws:  You will need an international driving permit or Angolan drivers license to drive. You may use a U.S. license for up to one month.\nCheckpoints : Both inside and around Luanda, police set up spontaneous roadblocks to check for vehicle documentation. They may also solicit bribes or request immediate payment of \"fines\" for alleged minor infractions. Police and military officials are sometimes undisciplined, and their authority should not be challenged. \nAccidents:  In the event of an automobile accident, remain at the scene until the police arrive.\nIf a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident.  Do not stop at the scene of an accident where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.\nLandmines:  Use caution in remote areas or off main roads outside of Luanda. Landmines are most common in the southern provinces. The provinces of Bie, Cuando Cubango Cuanza Sul, Moxico, and Huila have a higher prevalence of landmines than other areas of the country.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid all use of public transportation in multi-passenger vans known as  candongueiros  or motorcycles,  taxistas , and hire private transport from a reliable source. All public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. The U.S. Embassy has determined Allo Taxi is an acceptable rideshare service.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Angola, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Angola’s civil aviation authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Angola should also check for U.S.  maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website (https:homeport.uscg.mil), and the  NGA broadcast warnings website  select “broadcast warnings.”"

U.S. citizens with expired or damaged passports may not be allowed to enter and could be sent back to the United States at their own expense. Private U.S. citizens do not need a visa for visits of up to 90 days for tourism or business. Diplomatic or official passport holders must obtain visas prior to arrival.  \n \nVisit the Embassy of Argentina’s website for visa information at  https://eeeuu.cancilleria.gob.ar/en .\nThe U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires cannot help travelers with obtaining visas for other countries. U.S. citizens embarking on a cruise ship from Argentina that includes other countries, should verify if they need visas for those countries before boarding the ship. For more information, see the country specific information for the country you plan to visit. \nFor information about customs rules, please read our Customs Information page and the Argentine Customs page. \nSpecial Entry/Exit Requirements for Dual Nationals:    \nDifferent rules may apply to dual U.S.-Argentine citizens, depending on when they became U.S. citizens. Visit the Argentine  Immigration website  for the most current information. Generally, Argentine citizens are required to depart Argentina using an Argentine passport, including children of U.S. citizens who may be born in Argentina. \nSpecial Entry/Exit Requirements for Minors:  \nA parent or guardian traveling alone with a child under 18 who resides in Argentina must present to Argentine authorities a legalized permission letter in Spanish ( Autorización de Viaje ) from the non-accompanying parent upon departure from Argentina. Either parent may prepare an authorizing letter for the other parent to travel abroad with the child in case of emergency. (Please see the  Argentine immigration website  for more information). A local notary public (called an  escribano  in Argentina) may prepare the  autorización de viaje  letter. If this notarized authorization is prepared in the United States, Argentine authorities will require an apostille from the United States in addition to the notarized authorization. Please see this link for more information about an apostille:  Apostille Requirements.  For children born in the United States and who are residents in Argentina, Argentine authorities will require the U.S. birth certificate to be apostilled and translated into Spanish by a certified translator.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:   \nThe U.S. Department of State does not know of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for foreign visitors or residents of Argentina. \nMore Information:  Find information on dual nationality,  prevention of international child abduction  and customs regulations on our websites.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently in Buenos Aires and take place in other cities as well. Protesters often block streets and highways. Demonstrations are usually nonviolent, but always have the potential to turn confrontational.  Avoid demonstrations if possible.\nCrime:   Street crime is a problem in most urban areas including Buenos Aires City, Buenos Aires province, Rosario, and Mendoza. Look out for muggers, pickpockets, scam artists, cellphone and purse-snatchers who work on the street, in restaurants and hotel lobbies, at bus and train stations, in public transportation, and in cruise ship ports. \nRobberies:  Robberies involving motorcycles (called “motochorros”) occur frequently in cities. These thieves normally operate in pairs:  one operates the bike, an the other jumps off and takes the watches, purses, and backpacks of pedestrians. The motochorros also reach, or break, into cars to snatch valuable items.\nRobberies involving drugs that incapacitate victims are becoming more common in Argentina. Thieves use dating apps to schedule “dates,” at a hotel room or private residence and then drug and rob the victim. Individuals have also been drugged at bars when socializing with strangers.  Criminals identify potential drugging victims in bars, night clubs, or through dating apps. Consider meeting in a public area and always be cautious of accepting drinks from people or allowing others to have access to your drink.\nBe cautious when using ATMs. While withdrawing funds, victims are forced to take out as much money as possible and sometimes at different locations, maxing out their cards at each location.\nForeigners in Argentina have been the victims of kidnapping for ransom schemes. The victim is typically held for ransom and family members or co-workers are contacted to bring all the cash they have on hand or can gather in a couple of hours.  Once the ransom is paid, the victim is usually released unharmed. Fake telephone kidnappings are also common.\nThe U.S. Embassy receives many reports of stolen passports.  Passports and other valuables should be locked in a hotel safe.  Carry a photocopy of your passport with you.  In addition, U.S. citizen residents and visitors should safeguard personal information such as email addresses, telephone numbers, banking and other information, to protect against identity theft\nRobberies occur often, and violence is more likely to occur when victims resist. Do not leave your personal belongings unattended \n \n Taxi Scams:  Scams involving yellow and black taxis have been reported at international airports and around Buenos Aires. Pre-arrange a ride or select one of the flat-rate “remise” services (private car with driver) from the airport service counters. In town, use radio taxis from places like a hotel when possible.  See the  Department of State  and the FBI  Financial Crime I  pages for information on scams.  A few common scenarios follow:\nGeneral Precautions:\nClimbing, Hiking, and Trekking: Do not trek alone.  The U.S. Embassy in Argentina  strongly   discourages  U.S. citizens from hiking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. In recent years, U.S. citizens and other foreigners have disappeared or been seriously injured while solo climbing/hiking and trekking.  Sexual assaults have been reported against solo hikers and bikers on trails in regions along the border with Chile.  Hike in groups and remain alert to your surroundings . Follow Park Ranger and Search and Rescue Team advice and instructions.\nUpdate your SOS or GPS emergency locator information. Make sure your device is enabled to function in the park and your provider has the correct information for authorities. Add local rescue teams as your first emergency contact  (see recourses below)  and add the U.S. Embassy’s emergency contact phone number as an alternative: +54-11 5777-4354.\nBefore your trip check the following resources for reliable information about trail conditions and potential hazards in the most popular climbing, hiking and trekking regions in Argentina:\nWe strongly recommend that before you travel you purchase supplemental travel and evacuation insurance, provide family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to climbing, trekking, and hiking, and register your itinerary through the  Smart Traveler Enrollment Program  (STEP).\nPlease note: The Department of State assumes no responsibility or liability for the entities on the weblink list above. Inclusion on this list is in no way an endorsement by the Department or the U.S. government. The information on the links is provided directly by the local service providers; the Department is not in a position to vouch for such information \n \n Domestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.  If you are in immediate danger, call the police at 911.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, hospitals can provide urgent medical treatment, though very serious injuries often require medical evacuation.  U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .\nVictims of Crime:   \nWe can:\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws.

Insect repellant can be difficult to purchase during these months as well. We recommend bringing insect repellant (with Deet) in your checked luggage.\nFurther health information:\nSurrogacy:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Driving is more dangerous than in the United States. Drivers in Argentina tend to be aggressive, especially in Buenos Aires, and often ignore traffic regulations. Drivers should prepare in advance when taking long road trips and make sure to have adequate insurance coverage. Gas stations are often far apart and not always easily identified from the main roadway. You need an Argentine or international driver’s license to drive but verify with local authorities for the most current information.\nSee our  Road Safety page  and the website of Argentina's  national tourist office  for more information. \nAVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Argentina’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Argentina’s air carrier operations.

Individuals face the potential of discrimination and harassment by state and private actors. The Department of State’s Human Rights Report documents that LGB persons experienced physical violence, threats of violence, blackmail, and harassment. Police were often unresponsive to reports of abuse against LGB individuals and at times, themselves mistreated LGB persons.\nSee the  LGB travel information  page and section six of the  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  Armenia law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities but does not fully define “disability.” This law is not consistently enforced.

Demonstrations  occur periodically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizens who are victims of crime should report crimes to the local police and then contact the U.S. Embassy. Contact the local police by dialing 102 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+994 12) 488 3300.

Societal intolerance, discrimination, and violence based on sexual orientation remain a problem in Azerbaijan. It is not illegal to organize events in support of LGB persons, but societal intolerance generally prevented these events. LGB individuals have reported that employers sometimes found other reasons to fire LGB employees due to their sexual orientation. One of the main concerns for local LGB persons is the perceived failure of law enforcement agencies to act on violations of the rights of LGB persons and indifference to investigating crimes committed against LGB persons in Azerbaijan.

Be sure to leave Bahrain before your visa expires; otherwise, you will face heavy fines, possible arrest, and/or deportation. A visa extension to stay beyond the original expiration date is possible. An extension request must be submitted via the  Bahrain e-Visa website . Your visa must be valid for the duration of your stay in Bahrain. \nTo work in Bahrain you must have: \nConsult  Bahrain’s Labor Market Regulatory Authority  for complete details. \nObtain a valid work permit and signed employment contract before arriving in Bahrain. The contract should clearly state: \nDo not work in Bahrain on a tourist visa.  Even if employers advise you otherwise, Bahraini authorities will hold you personally liable if you do not have a valid work permit.\nHave all documents required for your employment permit authenticated before arriving . The U.S. Embassy in Manama cannot provide this service. For information on authentication of U.S.-issued documents, see  Authentication of American Academic Credentials for Use Abroad  and contact our  Office of Authentications . \nDo not allow your employer to retain your U.S. passport.  It is illegal, but a common practice, for Bahraini employers to retain your passport. Such retention could delay your travel or grant undue leverage to your employer in case of a dispute.\nWhile many U.S. citizens have a positive experience working in Bahrain, some employed in the education sector have complained about lack of private accommodations, delay in payment of salary, withholding of passports, delay in issuance of residency, and a debt-related travel ban on leaving the country if the employee breaks a contract and the sponsor requires repayment of travel costs.\nExit Restrictions:  If you have unpaid debt or are involved in legal proceedings, authorities may not allow you to leave Bahrain until the issue is resolved. Resolution may take several years. Additionally, this could force you to stay in Bahrain beyond the validity of your visa, at which point you would begin to accrue daily fines. The U.S. Embassy cannot pay your debt, fines, tickets, legal expenses or living expenses. \nResidents intending to return to Bahrain should   obtain a re-entry permit  valid for at least six months before leaving. Renew visas and residency permits through the  General Directorate of Nationality, Passports, and Residence (GDNPR) . \nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:  Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Bahrain. All declared HIV-positive foreigners risk immediate deportation. Although you are not required to declare HIV status upon arrival, the government may revoke visas of non-Bahrainis who are HIV positive. There may be a risk of getting tested for HIV without consent during a hospital visit. Please verify this information with the  Embassy of the Kingdom of Bahrain  before traveling.\nTravelers with HIV:  Carry enough medication to cover your intended stay. Pharmacies reportedly will not sell HIV/AIDS medication to non-Bahraini citizens without a permit from the Ministry of Health. Health facilities and pharmacies are required to report HIV-positive foreigners to the Ministry of Health, which could lead to deportation. \nBahrain does not recognize dual nationality,  though some exceptions are made. Bahraini dual nationals are required to declare and register their second nationality with the government.\nIf you are eligible for Bahraini citizenship, authorities will not issue you a Bahraini passport unless you renounce your U.S. citizenship.  \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations   on our websites. \n \n Military Travelers:  Please consult the  Department of Defense's (DOD) Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG)  prior to commencing travel to Bahrain. This applies to DOD Service Members, DOD Civilians, DOD Contractors, and U.S. Coast Guard personnel.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.

Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: \nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.  \nCrime : The crime rate in Bahrain is low, and violent crime is rare. Thieves and pickpockets are known to operate in the old market area. Common sense security precautions are effective in countering the threat of crime.\nDemonstrations  occur regularly in specific areas and are usually peaceful and not disruptive to public order .  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, during international events, at night and on weekends.  \nDemonstrations sometimes result in temporary road closures. Demonstrators occasionally burn tires, throw rocks, or lob Molotov cocktails in specific neighborhoods at night. In the past, they have used improvised explosive devices and shotgun-like projectile launchers against government security forces. The Ministry of Interior maintains official checkpoints and will deploy crowd control agents against demonstrators if it is determined that the protest is becoming unruly or could impact public security. In recent years, dialogue and community policing elements have been used to lower tensions and crowd control measures have been deployed as a last resort.\nNo U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted during protest activity. Local media outlets have sometimes expressed anti-U.S. sentiment, and demonstrators have occasionally burned U.S. flags. \nRemain alert to local security developments. For assistance, call the local police at 999.\nRestricted travel:  The U.S. Embassy restricts its employees from traveling to specific areas where protest activity is more likely and advises all U.S. citizens to do the same. \nSee the Embassy’s website for  travel restrictions  and  security updates .\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated, and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.\nGPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using GPS apps, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety considerations.\nBe cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(973) 1724-2700 (business hours) or +(973) 1727-5126 (after hours).

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\nSee our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Instructions for obtaining a visa are available on the  Embassy of Belarus website . Please note that the Government of Belarus has the authority to deny entry to any foreign visitor whether or not he/she has a visa.\nTravelling between Russia and Belarus \nCar and Train Travel:  Belarus and Russia do not have international passport control capabilities at the land border. Therefore, U.S. citizens and other foreigners, even those holding valid visas, may not cross the Belarusian – Russian border by car, train, or on foot. Only Russian and Belarusian passport holders may transit the land border. \nAir Travel:  U.S. citizens require a visa in order to travel by air between Belarus and Russia.

For this reason, it is recommended that U.S. citizens avoid all demonstrations and protest gatherings.\nForeigners may be  placed under surveillance . Hotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. \nTaking photographs  of anything that could be perceived as being of  military or security interest  may result in problems with authorities; these sites are not always clearly marked and application of these restrictions is subject to interpretation. \nCrime:  Belarus has a low rate of street crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare; criminals have been known to use force if met with resistance from victims. \nInternet-Dating Schemes and Cyber-Crime:  \"Internet brides\" are advertised on several websites and are not always legitimate.

If you enter Belize by land, you will be charged different fees depending on whether your stay is less than or more than 24 hours. Belize does not require specific immunizations for visitors; vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can be found at  Belize vaccinations .\nIf you are visiting as a tourist, you do not require a visa. Visitors planning to stay more than 30 days must have their passport re-stamped by a local immigration office and pay an additional fee for every additional month they wish to stay, up to six months. For visits longer than six months, you may need to provide further documentation to the local immigration office explaining the reason for a longer stay, and you may need to pay additional fees. Visit the  Embassy of Belize to the United States website  for the most current visa information.  \nTraveling with Minors:  If you are traveling with children, you may be asked by immigration officials to show U.S. birth certificates for each child. When children are not traveling with both parents, immigration officials often request documentation to establish the children are traveling with the permission of both parents. Documentation may include notarized letters from the parent(s), custody decree, adoption papers, or death certificates in situations where one or both parents are deceased.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:  We are unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Belize. Please verify this information with the  Embassy of Belize  before you travel.\nInformation about  dual nationality  or the  prevention of international child abduction  can be found on our website. \nBelize is rated high for crime and has one of the highest per capita murder rates in the world. Gang members and other criminals use violent means to resolve disputes. Visitors should exercise caution throughout Belize, particularly in the south side of Belize City and remote areas along Belize’s borders due to high crime.\nCrime:  Crime may occur anywhere in Belize, and criminals frequently target tourists, including those at resorts and on the roads and river ways. Crime, including sexual assault, armed robbery, and murder remains high and is distributed evenly throughout the country. Sexual harassment and/or assault of persons traveling alone or in small groups have been reported. \nMost crimes remain unresolved and unprosecuted. A lack of capacity, resources, and training impedes the ability of local police to effectively investigate crime and apprehend offenders.\nThefts of cash and credit cards happen frequently in some areas of Belize. It is believed several credit card fraud rings are currently active in Belize, particularly in San Pedro.\nScams occur in Belize, especially in resort areas. Tourists, in general, are particularly vulnerable to these crimes, resulting in visitors being pick-pocketed, robbed and/or extorted. See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police by dialing 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 822-4011. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. While the Embassy stands ready to assist the Belize authorities with any requests for technical assistance, the Embassy is not a law enforcement agency, cannot provide U.S. citizens with protection or investigate crimes against U.S. citizens, and has no jurisdiction to intervene in police or judicial processes. See our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . \n \nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the  U.S. Embassy in Belize  for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unavailable outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the  Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report .\nLGB Travelers:  The Belizean government in September 2016 conceded the decriminalization of homosexuality, but is questioning a section of a July 2016 Supreme Court ruling that made “sexual orientation” a protected class. The Immigration Act prohibits “homosexual” persons from entering the country, but immigration authorities have not enforced that law. \nThere continues to be significant hostile sentiment towards individuals who identify themselves as LGB. Tourist friendly areas, including San Pedro Town, Ambergris Caye, remain relatively open and welcoming to the LGB community. Outside of these areas, LGB persons, especially males, are reluctant to display affection in public (including holding hands) because incidents of verbal or physical assault have been reported. There have been some instances of violence reported against LGB individuals, and LGB groups have reported that the police at times refused to accept reports of crime from LGB persons.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of the  Department of State's Human Rights report  for further details.\nPersons with Mobility Issues : While in Belize, individuals with disabilities will find accessibility and accommodation very different from in the United States. The law does not expressly prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, air or other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other state services. The law does not provide for accessibility to persons with disabilities. Most public and private buildings and transportation are not accessible.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Women traveling alone or in small groups are targets for sexual assault, even in tourist areas. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nEmergency services will be either unavailable or significantly delayed. Serious injuries or illnesses normally require evacuation to another country.\nMedical care for minor ailments is generally available in urban areas. Advanced medical treatment is very limited in Belize City or Belmopan and is extremely limited or unavailable in rural and remote areas. Pharmacy services are generally acceptable in larger cities. Specialized prescription medications may be completely unavailable. If you bring your own prescription medications, you must carry a current doctor’s prescription for each medication. Please contact the Belize Customs Department at (501) 223-7092 or via e-mail at  cusnet@btl.net  for more information.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Veteran’s Administration health benefits do not apply overseas.\nMake sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on overseas insurance.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nCarry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nZika Virus : The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies Belize as a Zika risk area. The  Zika virus  is spread by the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. These mosquitoes bite during the day and night. Zika can be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Infection during pregnancy can cause certain birth defects.\nBe up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended  by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For additional information, including travel advisories, visit the  CDC website . \nThe following diseases are also prevalent in Belize:\nFor further health information, go to:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions in Belize range from two-lane paved roads to dirt or gravel tracks. Roads often lack markings, reflectors, and shoulders, which can contribute to cars overturning. Even in urban areas, most streets lack lane markings and contribute to chaotic conditions. Bridges on the major highways are often only a single lane. The Manatee Road (Coastal Road), leading from the Western Highway east of Belmopan to Dangriga, is mostly unpaved, easily flooded after storms and without services.  Driving at night is strongly discouraged.\nRoadside assistance can be difficult to summon as there are no public telephones along the road and emergency telephone numbers do not always function properly. While cell phone service is fairly reliable, reception in remote areas is spotty or non-existent.\nTraffic Laws:  Drivers operate vehicles on the right side of the road. Valid U.S. or international driver’s permits are accepted in Belize only for a period of three months after initial entry.\nIf you are involved in a traffic accident, contact the local police and explain the emergency. If you or someone with you is critically injured, then go to the nearest hospital. If there are no injuries or risk of life, do not move the vehicles and wait for the police to arrive. If possible, take pictures before any vehicles are moved. Do not leave the scene if there are no injuries. If you hit someone on the road, stop and give assistance; contact the local police and report the accident.\nBicycles are numerous and constitute a regular part of traffic. Cyclists, like drivers, do not always obey basic traffic laws. They commonly fail to obey red lights or stop signs and often ride against traffic. Cyclists and pedestrians often do not have any reflectors or bright clothing and can be difficult to spot traveling along Belize’s poorly lit roads.\nPlease refer to our  Road Safety  page for more information.\nPublic Transportation:  Taxis are prevalent in cities but not as common in rural areas. Taxis are identified by green license plates. Most visitors will need to call a taxi service to summon a taxi. Buses are used to travel between cities and are not common for short commutes. Uber and Lyft are not available in Belize. Secondhand and/or salvage vehicles and buses are often used for public transportation and may not have security features such as seatbelts and airbags. We suggest that you visit the  Belize Tourism Bureau website.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Belize, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Belize’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Attacks may occur with little or no warning. Western tourists have been kidnapped in Park Pendjari in northern Benin. U.S. government employees are restricted from personal travel to  Park Pendjari, Park W, other areas within 50 km of Benin’s northern border with Burkina Faso, and areas north of the RNIE 7 route from Banikoara to the Nigerian border (not including the cities of Kandi and Segbana). The U.S. Department of State recommends tourists reconsider travel to these areas.\nFor more information, see our  terrorism  page.\nCrime:  Street crime is a significant problem in urban areas. Robbery and muggings occur on major thoroughfares and in neighborhoods, including those where expatriates and diplomatic staff live, where popular bars and restaurants are located, and on the beaches near hotels frequented by international visitors. Most reported incidents involve the use of force, by armed persons, with minor injury to the victim. There have been reports of individuals impersonating police officers.\nTravelers should avoid the Dantokpa Market between the hours of dusk and dawn.\nDemonstrations  occur occasionally. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Benin.

Depending on the nature of an injury or illness, appropriate medical treatment may not be available in Benin. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .\nBeach Safety : Swimming conditions along Benin’s coastline are dangerous due to strong tides, waves, and rip currents, and several people drown each year. Some private beaches offer increased protection, such as sea walls.  Always learn about the water conditions at any beach before attempting to swim.\nMaritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

During the rainy season (from mid-June to mid-September), dirt roads become impassable. Four-wheel drive vehicles with full spare tires and emergency equipment are recommended.\nGasoline smuggled from Nigeria is widely available in glass bottles and jugs at informal roadside stands throughout Cotonou and much of the country. This gasoline is of unreliable quality, as it often contains water or other contaminants that can damage or disable your vehicle. Drivers should purchase fuel only from official service stations.

There have been no reports of gang violence targeted towards visitors to Bermuda, although gang-related shooting incidents have occurred and continue to occur throughout the island.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Consulate for assistance.  Report crimes to the local police at 1 (441) 295-0011 and contact the U.S. Consulate at 1 (441) 295-1342.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Consulate for assistance.\nBeach Safety:  Swimming areas at some popular beaches around Bermuda can have dangerous rip currents, and swimming in the ocean is not the same as swimming in a pool or lake. Wind, waves, the change of the tide, the slope of the beach, and other factors can cause strong currents and difficult swimming conditions to be present in the water even on the calmest days. U.S. citizens have drowned in Bermuda due to these conditions. Only swim when there is a lifeguard present and always remain in sight of them. Do not dive into water of unknown depth. Do not swim alone, especially at isolated beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while swimming.  For more information, please visit  Beach and Ocean Safety | American Red Cross . \nTourism:  The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regards to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .  \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws.  If you violate Bermuda’s laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.  \nBermuda Customs routinely boards visiting cruise ships with drug sniffing dogs and will arrest persons found to have any illegal drugs in their cabin. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Bermuda are severe, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and/or heavy fines. Having a prescription for marijuana or any other drug currently illegal in Bermuda will not protect you from arrest or prosecution for possession of that illegal drug.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:   If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately.  See our  webpage  for further information.\nSpecial Circumstances:  The Department of State warns United States citizens against taking any type of firearm, ammunition or component of a firearm into Bermuda.

A negative COVID-19 test (PCR and/or serology) is not required and there are no health screening procedures at airports and other ports of entry.   \nA passport with at least six months of validity remaining is required. U.S. citizens are permitted stays up to 90 days total within a 12-month period without a visa. The total stay permitted for each visit is recorded on the entry stamp by Botswana immigration officials and may be less than 90 days. Travelers who attempt to enter Botswana with a temporary passport  must have a visa to enter . Visas cannot be obtained upon arrival in Botswana, and U.S. citizens without a visa in a temporary passport will face fines and long administrative delays. \nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Botswana. However,  students beginning their studies  at the University of Botswana are required to take an HIV test.  \nFor additional information on entry requirements and the most current visa information, contact the  Embassy of the Republic of Botswana , 1531-1533 New Hampshire Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20036, telephone (202) 244-4990/1, fax (202) 244-4164 or the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Botswana to the United Nations, 103 E. 37th St., New York, N.Y., 10016, telephone (212) 889-2277, and fax (212) 725-5061. There are also honorary consuls in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston.

U.S. citizens applying for residency in Botswana should have their birth and marriage certificates apostilled by the U.S. state where the documents were issued before coming to Botswana.  \nOnly the Secretary of State in the State where the birth or marriage certificates were issued is authorized to apostille those documents. A list of these authorities in each state can be found on the  Hague website . Teachers moving to Botswana to teach should contact the issuing educational institution registrar’s office to obtain certified copies of their transcripts.  \nPlease see also the  Department of State website   regarding the types of documents that can and cannot be authenticated by the U.S. Embassy.  \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.  \nCRIME:   Non-confrontational crime and crimes of opportunity, primarily the theft of money and personal property, are common. Home invasions, break-ins, “smash and grabs” from vehicles at intersections and from locked cars in shopping mall parking lots, cell phone thefts, and muggings - often at knife point, are routinely reported to police. Hotels and lodges are not immune from criminal activity. Visitors should remain alert and take reasonable precautions to safeguard personal property (particularly money and electronic equipment). Crime is also reported in game parks, nature reserves, and remote areas frequented by tourists. \nYou should:  \nTravelers arriving in Botswana via South Africa should be aware of serious and continuing baggage pilferage problems at OR Tambo (Johannesburg) and Cape Town International Airports. It is suggested that you:  \nTravelers transiting and staying overnight in Johannesburg before departing for Botswana should exercise vigilance when departing the airport as foreigners have been the victims of “follow home” robberies.  \nVictims of Crime:   \nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. \nReport crimes to local police at 999 and if American Citizen Services assistance is required, contact the U.S. Embassy at + (267) 395-3982. The Botswana Police Service is responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.  \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .  \nWe can:  \nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. If you are at risk for bodily injury, contact the Botswana Police Service immediately for assistance \nTourism:  The tourism industry in Botswana is unevenly regulated. Many tourism operators provide top quality equipment and facilities; however, authorities conduct annual safety inspections for equipment and facilities inconsistently. Hazardous areas/activities are often, but not always, identified with appropriate signage, and some staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available in the capital, Gaborone, and in the cities of Maun, Francistown, and Kasane. First responders are generally able to access areas outside of the capital and to provide medical treatment, however there may be delays reaching remote areas. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  \nSome crimes are prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.  \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.  \nArrest Notification:   If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.  \nSPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES   \nPower and water:  Power outages can leave areas without electricity for several hours, and may affect home security systems, garage doors and gates, and kitchen equipment. Power surges may harm computers, televisions, or other electrical appliances. In times of drought, the Water Utilities Corporation may ration water.  \nGame and Animal Trophies:  Botswana strictly enforces its laws controlling trade in animal products, often by means of spot checks for illegal products on roadways or at airports. Violators are subject to arrest and may face a penalty of up to five years imprisonment and substantial fines. Unwitting U.S. citizens have been arrested and prosecuted under this law.  \nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:  \nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Botswana.   \nIn November 2021, the Botswana Court of Appeals ruled to officially decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity. There are no reports of police targeting persons suspected of same-sex sexual activity. There is stigma and discrimination against LGB persons particularly in villages and rural areas outside the capital. LGB travelers should exercise caution with regard to public displays of affection.  \nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for details.  \nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Botswana prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. \nThe government mandates access to public buildings and transportation for persons with disabilities, but civil society sources report access for persons with disabilities is limited. Many privately owned buildings and business, and older government buildings remain inaccessible. The law does not specifically include air travel with other modes of transportation but in general, persons with disabilities are provided access to air transportation.  \nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .  \nWomen Travelers:   See our travel tips for  Women Travelers . \nFor emergency services in Botswana, dial 999 for the Police, 998 for Fire, and 992 for Ambulance (MRI).  \nAmbulance services are: \nAdequately equipped private medical facilities, emergency rooms, and trained physicians are available in Gaborone for simple medical problems but services are rudimentary elsewhere. Ability to pay for care must be established before you will receive medical care. More advanced care is available in South Africa. Many South African manufactured prescription drugs are available in Gaborone, although there have been recent shortages of routine prescription drugs.  \nAvoid drinking tap water and ice made from tap water. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe to drink.  \nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.  \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on overseas insurance coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.   \nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.  \nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Botswana Medicines Regulatory Authority  to ensure the medication is legal in Botswana.   \nCheck with the government of  Botswana   to ensure the medication you are carrying is legal in Botswana. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.  \nThe following diseases are present:  \nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \nFurther health information:   \nHealth facilities in general:   \nAdequate health facilities are available in Gaborone and other major cities but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards.     \nHospitals usually require advance payment or proof of adequate insurance before admitting a patient.    \nGenerally, in public hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight. Consider hiring a private nurse or having family spend the night with the patient, especially a minor child.   \nPatients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.  \nPsychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions      \nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery: \nPharmaceuticals:    \nNon-Traditional Medicine:  \n  U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Botswana. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.   \nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:  \n  Although surrogacy agencies/clinics claim surrogacy is legal in Botswana, there is no legal framework for foreigners or same-sex couples to pursue surrogacy in Botswana. As a result, surrogacy agreements between foreign or same-sex intending parents and gestational mothers are not enforced by Botswana courts.   \nWater Quality:  \n  In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.   \nAdventure Travel   \nGeneral Health Language:    \nAir Quality:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Roads in major population centers are generally good but rural roads can be in poor condition. Traffic lights and streetlamps often do not work properly. Approach traffic lights with caution as opposing traffic frequently continues well after a red light. The combination of long stretches of two-lane highways without shoulders or lights, high speed limits, free-range domestic animals, intoxicated drivers, and large numbers of pedestrians and hitchhikers in the roadways make fatal accidents a frequent occurrence, especially on weekends and end-of-month Friday paydays.  \nTraffic Laws:  Traffic circulates on the left in Botswana. A valid international driver’s license, along with vehicle registration documents, is required to drive in Botswana and drivers should always carry them. Traffic accidents should be reported to the Botswana Police Service.  \nPublic Transportation:  Local citizens travel around and out of Gaborone in low-cost, cash-only “combis” and taxis that are typically flagged down on the roadside. Tourists do not typically take combis. Taxis are generally safe and can be arranged through hotels or at the airport. Scheduled coach bus service is available between Botswana and South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Zambia and is generally a safe mode of transport. Internal bus services, typically used by local citizens, link many towns and villages across Botswana.  \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nVisit the website of  Botswana’s national tourist office   and national authority responsible for road safety \nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered Botswana, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Botswana’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page . "

When a minor travels with both parents, no written authorization is needed. When the minor travels with only one parent or without either parent, s/he  must have two original written authorization letters from each absent parent  and carry a copy* of the child’s birth certificate or have an annotation in his/her Brazilian passport authorizing travel alone or with only one parent. Brazilian citizen minors without authorization letters and a birth certificate* or an annotated Brazilian passport likely will not be allowed by authorities to pass through immigration or to board a flight departing Brazil.     \nThe U.S. Embassy and its consulates cannot intervene in Brazilian immigration matters or request that this requirement be waived for U.S. citizen travelers.\nWritten Authorization Letter:  If the absent parent is in Brazil, written authorization letters must be in Portuguese and notarized by a Brazilian notary. If the absent parent is in the United States or elsewhere outside of Brazil, the authorization must be done at the nearest Brazilian Embassy or Consulate using the form provided by that office. Again, please note that Brazilian law requires two original authorizations for each absent parent. This is important, because Federal Police may request and retain one authorization upon the minor’s entry into Brazil. Authorities may then request the second original document upon the minor’s departure.  Authorizations written in English or executed before a U.S. (or any non-Brazilian) notary public are not accepted by the Brazilian Federal Police.  Similarly, birth certificates issued outside of Brazil that are not  apostilled * and translated by a certified translator may not be accepted.\nBrazilian Passport Annotation:  In lieu of carrying authorization letters, parents of dual U.S.-Brazilian citizen minors may instead request an annotation be placed in the minor’s Brazilian passport authorizing the minor to travel with only one parent, or to travel alone or with a third party. This annotation replaces the requirement for written authorization letters until the passport expires. Parents residing in Brazil should contact the Brazilian Federal Police for details on obtaining an annotated passport. Parents residing abroad should contact the nearest Brazilian Embassy or Consulate. The annotated Brazilian passport must not be expired and must be carried along with the minor’s U.S. passport at all times for Brazilian Federal Police to accept it in lieu of an authorization letter. There is no comparable annotation available in U.S. passports.\nChildren who are not dual citizens of Brazil:  Please note that, while Brazilian law related to travel authorization does not explicitly apply to non-citizens of Brazil, Federal Police have, at times, delayed the travel of non-Brazilian minors who lack appropriate authorization from both parents. For this reason, we recommend that families of non-Brazilian minors who may travel through Brazil without one or both parents execute written authorizations (following the instructions in the preceding paragraph) in advance of travel and ensure that the minor, or the minor’s traveling companion, carries the original or notarized copy** of the minor’s birth certificate.\nAn exemplar of the form used by Brazilian authorities to document parental permission for minors to travel without one or both parents may be found here.\n*There is a useful pamphlet published by the Hague Conference called “ The ABCs of Apostilles .” The Brazilian competent authority that issues apostilles is the  Conselho Nacional de Justiça .\n**If the birth certificate was issued in Brazil, copies must be notarized by a Brazilian notary. If issued outside of Brazil, copies must be apostilled and translated by a certified translator into Portuguese.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Brazil.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nCrime:  The violent crime rate is high in most Brazilian urban centers. Public transportation, hotel sectors, and tourist areas report high crime rates, but these incidents can happen anywhere and at any time.  Be aware of your surroundings.\nTo reduce the chance of becoming the victim of a crime, in addition to the above recommendations, please review the below precautions:\nDemonstrations  and strikes are common in urban areas, may occur unexpectedly, disrupt transportation, and may escalate into violence.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime: \nU.S. citizen victims of crime should contact the local authorities to file a Brazilian police report before departing Brazil. In most instances, you can report crimes to the tourist or civil police. U.S. citizens should also inform the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate, but local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nThe local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Brazil is divided among four services:\nVictims of Domestic Violence or Sexual Assault:  Contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate for assistance after contacting local authorities.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are inconsistent. Inquire with property management about the presence and functionality of safety equipment, such as fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors. Hazardous areas/activities are normally identified with appropriate signage in major urban centers but may not be in other locations. Tourism industry staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate and timely medical treatment is consistently available only in or near major cities. First responders can face delays accessing areas outside of major cities to quickly provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on  insurance providers for overseas coverage\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.  \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFirearms:  Brazil forbids importing, exporting, and possessing firearms without prior authorization of the Brazilian Government. U.S. citizens are subject to arrest and prosecution in Brazil for possession of unauthorized firearms or firearm components anywhere in the country, including airports. This prohibition extends to spent shell casings or ammunition, even if inside luggage during transit, regardless of whether those items were legally purchased in the United States or elsewhere.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nWater Hazards:  Many of Brazil’s beaches have very dangerous riptides, even if the water looks safe. Ocean currents and waves are unpredictable, even in popular beaches frequented by tourists. Shark attacks are reported in the waters of some beaches in northeastern Brazil, particularly near Recife. Always observe posted warnings and never swim while under the influence of alcohol. Follow local authorities’ guidance and refrain from swimming alone in areas marked with red warning signs or at beaches where there are no municipal lifeguards or first responder services.\nElectricity Blackouts:  Power failures in large urban centers are common and sometimes followed by increased crime. Most tourist hotels are equipped with generators, minimizing the impact of a blackout, but you should remain cautious.\nNatural Disasters:  Flooding and mudslides occur throughout the country and can be fatal. Monitor news and weather reports and adhere to municipal advisories before traveling to areas prone to flooding or landslides. Many of Brazil’s larger cities have frequent heavy rainstorms that cause flash flooding and can disrupt traffic.\nCustoms Restrictions : Contact the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, D.C. or one of Brazil's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding import and export regulations. Please also refer to our  information on customs regulations .\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Brazil does not have legal restrictions on same-sex marriage, relations, or events coordinated by LGB organizations.

Please verify turn-around time with your chosen lab before taking the test.  Express results within 2-4 hours are available in many locations at an increased fee, including in the Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo and Galeão International Airport in Rio de Janeiro. Testing is available in the private sector without a doctor’s prescription, but a prescription may be required for insurance payment.\nIn the public healthcare system, each Brazilian state has its own COVID-19 testing plan. We recommend that you  contact local/state authorities for more information.  Typically, a COVID-19 test is ordered by an emergency room physician and then sent to a public lab. Turnaround time is much slower and can take up to seven days, but tests are generally free.  Information on testing sites and procedures is available through the  official app of the Ministry of Health.\nCOVID-19 Vaccines:  The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Brazil once they register with the public Unified Health System (SUS) .  According to the Ministry of Health, available vaccines include AstraZeneca/Oxford (Fiocruz), CoronaVac (Butantan), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), and Pfizer (BioNTech). For more information on local availability of COVID-19 vaccines, please see the  Brazilian Ministry of Health’s website  and also contact  local health authorities .    \nFor emergency services in Brazil, dial 192.\nAmbulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except in state capitals and other large cities. \nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on overseas insurance coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the  Government of Brazil  to ensure the medication is legal in Brazil. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. \nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThough the yellow fever vaccine is not required to enter Brazil, travelers wishing to be vaccinated should consider receiving it prior to travel, as local supplies are limited. Please note that the yellow fever vaccine should be administered ten days prior to travel for it to be effective.\nAlso note that, while yellow fever vaccine is not required to enter Brazil, some neighboring countries (French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Bolivia, and Paraguay) do require travelers with recent entries in Brazil to show proof of yellow fever vaccination.\nAll travelers to the country are advised to carry documentation, such as a vaccination card, that they have been appropriately vaccinated for yellow fever.\nThe following diseases are prevalent in Brazil:\nIn recent years, outbreaks of these diseases have also been detected in certain areas of Brazil:\nElective Surgery : Although Brazil has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in Brazil, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available and professionals are accredited and qualified. Some “boutique” plastic surgery operations offer luxurious facilities but are not hospitals and are unable to handle emergencies. \nVisit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  website for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to Brazil.\nNon-traditional Medicine: Several U.S. citizens have died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Brazil. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities if seeking such services.\nFurther health information:\nPublic Transportation:  Consider avoiding the use of public, municipal buses in Brazil at any time of day, and especially at night. Crime trends indicate an elevated risk of robbery or assault on public bus systems throughout Brazil. The U.S. government recommends against personnel using public, municipal buses in all parts of Brazil.\nPublic buses are one of the main modes of inter-city road travel. Buses can range (depending on route and price) from luxurious and well-maintained to basic and mechanically unsound. Bus hijacking can occur at random.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Driving on Brazil's roads poses significant risks. Poor driving skills, bad roads, and high-density traffic make road travel more hazardous than in the United States. Road maintenance is inadequate in many areas and some long-distance roads through the Amazon forest are impassable much of the year due to flooding. \nApart from toll roads, which generally have their own services, roadside assistance is available only sporadically and informally through local mechanics. The fastest way to summon assistance in an emergency anywhere in the country is to dial 193, a universal number staffed by local fire departments. This service is in Portuguese only.\nTraffic Laws:  Travelers planning on staying for more than 180 days should obtain an Inter-American Driving Permit to carry with their valid U.S. license if they plan to drive in Brazil. Such permits can be obtained through AAA or other sources. Please note:\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.

Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Sofia as being a LOW-threat location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.  \nCrime:  U.S. government personnel are not prohibited from traveling to any specific areas of Bulgaria due to crime. Most criminal acts in Bulgaria take place in Sofia. Other districts with a slightly lower level of crime than Sofia are Varna, Plovdiv, Burgas, and Stara Zagora. The lowest crime levels are in the districts of Smolyan, Kardzhali, Vidin, Silistra, and Razgrad. Most of Bulgaria experienced a decrease in crime in 2021 compared to 2020.\nATM skimming, credit card fraud, and traffic incidents remain the most common threats to U.S. citizens in Bulgaria. Majority of incidents involving U.S. citizens are monetary in nature, though incidents of racism, ethnic slurs, and harassment of African Americans and religious minorities have occurred. Report crimes to the police by dialing  112.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. They mainly occur in downtown Sofia in the areas surrounding and between Parliament and the Presidency. \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.   \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.

LGB individuals engaging in public displays of affection may attract unwelcome attention or harassment.\nAccording to LGB organizations, courts rejected the right of same-sex partners for protection against domestic violence because the law treats “spousal” only as applying to married persons who cannot legally be the same sex. The Commission for Protection against Discrimination reported receiving very few cases regarding sexual orientation.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section six of our  Human Rights report  for further details.  \nTravelers with Disabilities:   Bulgarian law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, and access to health care, but societal discrimination persists. Bulgarian law requires improved access to buildings for persons with disabilities and new public projects take this requirement into account, but authorities rarely enforce this law in older buildings. Commuting in Bulgaria is very difficult for disabled individuals. Buses, trams, and trolleys generally lack accommodation for disabled travelers.

The correct web address for the  Embassy of Burkina Faso in Washington DC  is  www.burkina-usa.org ; the site for  Burkina Faso’s Permanent Mission to the UN  is  www.burkina-onu.org . \nTravelers older than nine months should have proof of yellow fever immunizations, or you may be denied entry.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions: The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Burkina Faso. Find information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction, and Customs Information on our websites.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction ,  and  Customs Information  on our websites.\nSee the Department of State’s  Travel Advisory for Burkina Faso  and  Worldwide Caution  for current security information.\nTerrorism:  Violent extremist elements, remain active in Bukina Faso and throughout the region. They have specifically targeted Westerners in attacks and kidnappings. Since January 2016, extremist groups have conducted numerous cross-border attacks in the Sahel region. In addition to attacking police stations, customs offices, military posts, and schools in the Sahel region, extremists have attacked Ouagadougou three times since Janaury 2016.\nOn March 2, 2018, extremists attacked the French Embassy and Burkina Faso’s military headquarters in downtown Ouagadougou. Eight security force personnel, including soldiers and police officers, were killed, and over 80 others were injured. In August 2017, a small group of armed men attacked the Aziz Istanbul Café, a restaurant in downtown Ouagadougou, and killed approximately 19 people.\nCivil Unrest:  Demonstrations may occur throughout Burkina Faso with little or no advance warning. Maintain a surplus of supplies including food, water, fuel, and medical supplies in case you need to shelter-in-place.\nU.S. citizens should remain vigilant and utilize appropriate personal security practices, including: \nCrime:  Street crime is prevalent in major cities and foreigners are often directly targeted. Cellular telephones, jewelry, laptops, money and other items of value are the frequent targets of thieves. The majority of street crime is committed after dark and is often perpetrated by one or two individuals on motorbikes. Street crime typically increases in Ouagadougou around the holidays, the bi-annual West African Movie Festival (FESPACO), and the bi-annual Regional Craft Festival (SIAO).\nRemain vigilant in crowded areas and secure your personal belongings are at all times. Avoid traveling alone after dark as security risks increase at night. Be alert and aware of your surroundings, travel with a group of people if possible, and avoid poorly lit streets and narrow alleys. Criminals in urban areas may carry a knife or sharp weapon in order to cut the straps on bags, purses, or backpacks and can become violent if the victim resists. Ordinarily, thieves do not threaten victims with weapons, although there have been thefts and attempted thefts involving firearms and knives.\nResidential thefts/home invasions occur occasionally in the Ouagadougou expatriate community centered in Ouaga 2000, Koulouba, and Zone du Bois, and in other parts of Ouagadougou. Thieves enter residences at night but generally avoid direct confrontation with the occupants. Most perpetrators exploit an unlocked door or window.\nTravel in convoys when outside of major urban areas to deter roadside crime. Robberies can take place anwhere along the country’s roads, but local police cite the Eastern Region beyond Koupela, toward Fada N’Gourma due to its isolated location and intermittent cell phone coverage. According to police statistics, more than half of all reported roadside robbery incidents occurred in the this area. Criminals often use spotters at highway checkpoints and bus stations to identify potential victims. While criminals mainly steal valuables, they may physically harm victims during the course of a robbery.\nExercise caution when traveling along the northern areas of the country near the Mali and Niger borders. The Government of Burkina Faso and the U.S. Embassy have limited ability to provide assistance in the Sahel Reserve region.  The U.S. Embassy has placed restrictions on official government travel to Dori, Djibo, the east-west road that connects these cities, and all areas north of that road . U.S. citizens are encouraged to follow the same guidance.  \nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at 10-10 and contact the U.S. Embassy.

Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the  Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report .\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Burkina Faso. However, LGB persons are at times threatened and face societal discrimination. Same-sex civil unions or marriages are not recognized by the government, nor do LGB organizations receive official recognition by the government.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Accommodation and accessibility for individuals with disabilities is limited in Burkina Faso. Access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with disabilities. Most cafés, restaurants, hotels, and residential buildings have stairs at the entrance without wheelchair ramps. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations for disabled persons.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips.\nWomen Travelers:  Although the law prohibits violence against women, domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is widely reported. Wives have limited legal recourse in cases of abuse. There is no reliable data on the extent of sexual assault though it is a problem. Rape cases are usually not sent to trial. Police generally investigate reports of rape, but victims often do not file reports due to cultural barriers and fear of reprisal.\nThe law prohibits Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting, but it is practiced widely, particularly in rural areas, and usually performed at an early age.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nEarly Marriage:  The legal age for marriage is 17 for girls and 20 for boys, but child marriage is a problem. The law prohibits forced marriage. Polygyny is permitted, but a woman must agree to it prior to marriage.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Burkina Faso to ensure the medication is legal in Burkina Faso.

You can get hepatitis A and typhoid through contaminated food or water in Burkina Faso, make sure to stay up-to-date on vaccinations.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions may vary throughout the country. Major urban and intercity roads are paved, but can be narrow and full of potholes. Rural roads outside of major arteries are often in poor condition and roadside assistance is not available.\nTraffic Laws:  In addition to regular traffic, there are large volumes of mopeds, bicycles, pedestrians, donkey carts, hand-cranked wheel chairs and push-carts present on main thoroughfares. Drivers must exercise defensive driving to avoid accidents. The law requires moped operators to carry driver’s licenses and wear helmets, but it is not well-enforced.\nRoadways are poorly lit, making travel at night especially dangerous. Many cars, mopeds and bicycle riders do not use headlights and are very difficult to see on the roads at night. Flooding is a major problem during the rainy season in parts of Burkina Faso, causing severe damage to roads and buildings.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid using buses and local (green) taxis. Buses have been involved in catastrophic accidents and been targeted by roadside criminals. Green taxis are often mechanically unsafe, pick up multiple passengers in asingle taxi, and have been connected to criminal activity involving its passengers. There are a handful of yellow taxi cab services that are acceptable and utilize centralized dispatchers, fare meters, seatbelts, and well-maintained automobiles. Exercise caution and remain aware of your personal belongings at all times.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Burkina Faso, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Burkina Faso’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

When in country, you will be required to show your passport with a valid visa at all airports, train stations, and hotels. Security checkpoints are common.\nVisa Information:  Burma's  eVisa program  allows tourists and business travelers to apply for a visa online rather than physically applying at an embassy or consulate:\nBurma has a  visas-on-arrival program  for certain business travelers. The program is available only to those with a formal letter of invitation from a business registered with the Burmese Ministry of Commerce, NOT to tourists. Please contact the Embassy of Burma in Washington, DC, or other locations, for information.\nThere is also a meditation visa for visitors planning long-term studies at monasteries and meditation centers.\nU.S. Military Travelers:  Personal travel for U.S. military personnel to Burma is restricted at this time. U.S. military personnel must refer to the Department of Defense  Foreign Clearance Guide  and their officer-in-charge for information before planning any travel.\nDual Nationals:  Anyone entering Burma who has claim to Burmese citizenship, regardless of any other citizenship held, may need to meet all obligations of a Burmese citizen, including any required military conscription.\nBurma’s military conscription law was first introduced in 2010 but historically was not widely implemented. The military regime officially implemented the law in April 2024. In general, Burmese males aged 18 to 35 and Burmese females aged 18 to 27 will need to register for military service and report for duty if ordered by regime authorities. Burmese males aged 18 to 45 and Burmese females aged 18 to 35 in specific expert/professional occupations must serve if called upon by the regime. For more information, please refer to the Myanmar People’s Military Service Law (State Peace and Development Council Law No. 27/2010), also known as the Public Military Service Law. The military regime may refuse to acknowledge U.S.-Burmese dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, prevent their departure from Burma, and/or conscript them into the military.

Travelers should avoid travel to these areas.\nThe destinations frequented by most U.S. citizen visitors, including Rangoon, Bagan, Ngapali Beach, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay, are not currently affected by this fighting, but the security situation can change quickly. See our  Travel Advisory  for more information.\nLand mines and unexploded ordnance:  Conflict-affected areas are of greatest concern, particularly areas of Shan, Chin, and Kachin States. The location of landmines is often not marked or otherwise identifiable.\nThe regime’s Ministry of Hotels and Tourism publishes information on restricted areas.\nDue to travel restrictions placed on U.S. diplomats by the de-facto authorities, our ability to assist U.S. citizens affected by incidents in remote and/or conflict-affected areas of Burma may be limited.\nCrime:  Crime rates in Burma, especially involving foreigners, are lower than those of many other countries in the region. Nevertheless, the crime rate has been increasing, particularly home burglaries and petty crime. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. Citizens are advised to take particular care when taking taxis late at night.\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for more information.\n \nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at 199 or in person at the police station in the district where the crime took place; and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(95) (1) 7536-509, ext. 4240, Emergency After-Hours Telephone: +(95) 1 7536-509.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nDisaster Preparedness\nThe Department of Homeland Security’s page has numerous resources on emergency kits, preparing for disasters and developing emergency plans:  https://www.ready.gov/.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .  \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on  crimes against minors abroad  and the U.S.  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our  webpage  for further information.\nShould you be detained, especially outside of Rangoon, we may not be able to assist quickly.\nLaw enforcement officials do not routinely notify us of the arrest of U.S. citizens,  and prison officials have been known to obstruct regular access by consular officers to U.S. citizen detainees.\nDual Nationality:  Burmese law forbids Burmese citizens from possessing dual nationality. On occasion, Burmese authorities have detained and pursued criminal proceedings against Burmese-Americans who have returned to Burma on U.S. passports and who have had in their possession evidence of Burmese citizenship, such as a National Registration Card.\nTourists Must Reside in a Registered Hotel or Guesthouse:  Burmese law requires that foreign tourists reside in registered hotels or guesthouses. Criminal penalties, including multiple years of imprisonment and deportation, apply for non-compliance.\nIllegal drugs  carry severe penalties. Expect long jail sentences under harsh conditions, heavy fines, or even execution for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs.\nInsulting Religion:  Under Burmese law, insulting religion is a prosecutable offense. ‘Insult’ is a very broad term that could include tattoos or other religious representations in a non-religious context.  Images of the Buddha can be particularly sensitive. In 2016, a tourist was deported for allegedly having a tattoo of the Buddha on his leg. In 2020, a Facebook user from Meikhtila who criticized monks on social media was sentenced to over a year imprisonment; two other individuals were arrested for drawing graffiti of a skull wearing a monk’s robe. As in any country, visitors are encouraged to be respectful of local customs when visiting religious sites.\nDrones:  Importing unmanned aerial systems (drones) without prior permission from authorities and flying them in sensitive areas can result in criminal penalties, including jail time and the permanent confiscation of the drone. Sensitive areas include government buildings, famous tourist sites, and religious buildings. Because it is rarely clear what constitutes a sensitive area, all recreational use of drones is inadvisable.  Multiple foreigners have recently been detained for flying drones in sensitive locations.\nSocial Media:  You may be prosecuted for posting negative or derogatory comments on social media, including Facebook, under the 2013 Telecommunications Law, which criminalizes “extortion of any person, coercion, unlawful restriction, defamation, interfering, undue influence, or intimidation using a telecommunications network.” If convicted, you may face a fine and/or imprisonment. \n \nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal under section 377 of the Burmese penal code, which has provisions against “sexually abnormal” behavior and entails punishments up to life imprisonment. Laws against “unnatural offenses” apply equally to men and women. These laws are rarely enforced; however, LGB persons have reported police using the threat of prosecution to extort bribes. LGB activists have also reported allegations of rape by security forces in some cases, arbitrary arrest (for example for loitering), detention, and broad societal and familial discrimination.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  Individuals with disabilities should be prepared to face difficulties throughout Burma. Roads and sidewalks are often difficult to cross. Ramps or handicapped-accessible facilities are rare. \nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in Burma, dial 119.\nCOVID-19 Testing:\nTesting is available at the following locations: \nCOVID-19 Vaccines: \n  The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Burma. Some private clinics in Burma offer COVID-19 vaccination programs, including booster shots.  American citizens in Burma seeking vaccination should contact private clinics directly for more information.  The Embassy shares this information as a courtesy but does not endorse or recommend any specific vaccination program in Burma. \nAmbulance services are:\nGiven the above information, injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nMost medical facilities in Burma are inadequate for routine medical care. If you are seeking medical care in Burma, you will be asked to pay cash for all health care services and medicines before receiving care; credit cards are not accepted in most health care facilities and insurance will not be billed. Adequate Emergency Medical Services including ambulance care is not reliably available. Patients who are admitted to public hospitals typically need a family member or friend to assist them with care in the hospital, and food and medical supplies must be purchased for use in the hospital. Few medical personnel in Burma are trained to U.S. standards.\nU.S. citizens needing urgent medical care have been denied treatment at public hospitals due to a lack of funds.  In an emergency, you would likely need to be medically evacuated to a hospital outside Burma . Medical evacuation from Burma is expensive and is most often transacted in cash, therefore medical evacuation insurance is advised.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation (see above).\nMedication:  Many pharmaceuticals on sale in Burma are counterfeit or adulterated, or may not be available. Travelers should consider Burmese pharmaceuticals generally unsafe to use and should bring their own medications for the duration of their stay in Burma.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with  these authorities  to ensure that the medication is legal in Burma.  Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Rangoon's roads are generally in poor condition, and traffic is congested throughout the day. Slow-moving vehicles, bicycles, animals, and heavy pedestrian traffic create numerous hazards for drivers on Rangoon's streets. If you drive in Burma, remain alert to avoid hitting pedestrians. If you are a pedestrian, remain alert even when you believe you have the right of way.\nMost roads outside of Rangoon have one to two lanes and are potholed, often unpaved, and unlit at night.  Many of the truck drivers traveling between China and Rangoon reportedly travel under the influence of methamphetamines and other stimulants. Drunken and/or drugged drivers are common during the four-day Buddhist water festival in mid-April.\nDriving at night is particularly dangerous. Most Burmese drivers do not turn on their headlights until the sky is completely dark. Many do not use headlights at all. Many bicyclists use no lights or reflectors.\nRoadside assistance and ambulances are generally unavailable.\nPublic Transportation:  Please refer to our  Road Safety  page for more information.\nTraffic Laws:  Vehicles drive on the right side as in the United States, however, a majority of vehicles still have the steering wheel positioned on the right. The “right of way” concept is generally respected, but military convoys and motorcades always have precedence. Vehicles generally lack seat belts. Child car seats are unavailable.\nMost accidents are settled between the parties on site, with the party at fault paying the damages. In the event of an accident with a pedestrian, the driver is always considered to be at fault and subject to fines or arrest, regardless of the circumstances.\nAviation Safety Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Burma, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Burma’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Most transactions are conducted in cash. Credit cards are rarely accepted outside of a few upmarket hotels and restaurants in Bujumbura. Most vendor and banking institutions will take only U.S. bills in near-mint condition, printed after 2009. Examine U.S. bills to ensure they are legitimate.\nBe aware that hotels will require payment in U.S. dollars from foreigners not resident in Burundi.\nExchange currency only at reputable banks. ATMs are available at the international airport and in Bujumbura, but they dispense only Burundian francs. The U.S. Embassy does not exchange currency for U.S. citizens.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\n \nLGB Travelers:  Burundian law criminalizes consensual same-sex relations with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment of three months to two years, but prosecutions are rare. People have, however, been detained based on their perceived sexual orientation.

Most buildings lack functioning elevators.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Sexual and domestic violence, including rape, is a widespread problem. Center Seruka and Center Nturengaho provide shelter and counseling to survivors of rape and domestic violence. Several international NGOs provide free medical care for survivors, mostly in urban areas. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nHealth facilities throughout the country are well below the U.S. standard of care. Training of staff and general hygiene and sanitation remain a problem. Adequate health facilities for basic medical care are available in Bujumbura and at some other locations. If you do need medical care, you will be asked to pay cash in advance and may be denied treatment if unable to do so. Credit cards are generally not accepted; insurance companies are not billed.\nThere is no single number for emergency medical services in Burundi. Contact  a doctor or hospital  directly.\nAmbulance services are:\nInjured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\n \nThe U.S. Government does not pay private medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\n \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.

Check with the  Burundi Ministry of Public Health  to ensure the medication is legal in Burundi.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\n \nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality available at some U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nAir pollution is a moderate problem in several major cities in Burundi. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling, if appropriate. Respiratory issues have been reported more frequently when the air quality is worse, particularly in the drier months. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:\n \nHealth facilities in general\nPharmaceuticals\n \nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy\n \nWater Quality\nAdventure Travel\nGeneral Health:  The following diseases are prevalent:\nOther diseases that may be present, but are not prevalent:\nUse mosquito repellents recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers, even for short stays.\nHIV/AIDS: HIV transmission within Burundi is lower in comparison to other countries in sub–Saharan Africa; however, the risk of transmission remains higher than in the United States. Visitors should exercise caution and avoid unprotected sexual activity.\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Resources for Travelers  regarding specific issues in Burundi.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains  a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  National highways vary in condition from good to very poor. Large potholes are common. During the main rainy season from February to May, many roads become impassable. Flooding and landslides also destroy bridges and block routes. Many roads in the interior of the country are in disrepair. U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from driving outside of Bujumbura before 05:00 and after 18:30. There is a general lack of:\nThe above conditions make driving dangerous, particularly outside of cities and at night. Poor driving standards and pedestrians, cyclists, and livestock on the roads create further hazards. There have also been recent incidents of pedestrians struck and killed by minibuses. Exercise extra caution while walking on or alongside a road.\nMotorists in Burundi should be careful to keep their doors locked and windows closed when driving around the capital. Fuel shortages are common, leading to very long lines at service stations that can last for hours or days. Outside Bujumbura, service stations are scarce, and fuel is often unavailable. Professional roadside assistance is limited outside the capital. Carry with you:\nTraffic Laws:  An international driving permit and third-party insurance is required. Long-term residents can apply for a Burundi driver’s license. Use of cell phones while driving is illegal. Give buses and taxis a wide berth as they start and stop abruptly, often without pulling to the side of the road. Many passenger doors on buses open on the side facing the road and passengers may emerge into traffic.\nThere are many right-hand drive vehicles in Burundi, although Burundi is a left-hand drive country.\nIn the case of an accident, call and attempt to have police respond. If a hostile crowd forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident you see or come upon.\n \nPublic Transportation:  Public transit is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe due to overloading, reckless driving, inadequate vehicle maintenance, and the risk of petty crime. Hire private transportation from a reliable source. U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from using public transportation, including taxis, taxi-motos, taxi-bikes and buses. Fatal collisions occur frequently. Due to security concerns, the bus depots near the former Central Market are also off-limits to U.S. Embassy personnel.\nIf you use a taxi, negotiate the fare before beginning your journey. Taxis are not metered, so confirm the fare with your hotel or before entering a taxi.\n \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Burundi, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Burundi’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Several small fishing boats have been lost at sea, and drownings have occurred on the beaches and along the coast in Santiago, Sal, and on other islands. \nThe entire island of Fogo is an active volcano. Future eruptions remain a threat, as do earth tremors throughout the islands, especially on Fogo, Brava, and Santo Antão, and beneath the ocean channels that separate them. General information about natural disaster preparedness is available  on our website .\nCrime :  Petty crime and burglary are common in Cabo Verde, especially at marketplaces, festivals, street fairs, and public gatherings. Criminals target anyone perceived to be affluent, regardless of nationality. Avoid groups of children who appear to have no adult supervision, since the perpetrators of petty theft and pickpocketing are often groups of street children. Muggings occur often, particularly at night and in more isolated areas, and often involve violence. The perpetrators are predominantly males between the ages of 14 and 25 operating in groups of two or more. Due to inadequate lighting in many public areas, you should be especially vigilant after dark, carry a flashlight to illuminate your path, and never go out alone. You should also keep vehicle doors and windows locked and avoid isolated places. \nIt is dangerous to use hillside stairways connecting neighborhoods in Praia and many other Cabo Verdean cities and towns, even in broad daylight. These stairways isolate users and make them vulnerable to assault. \nInternational Financial Scams :  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information. \nVictims of Crime :  U.S. citizen victims of crime are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. \nReport crimes to the local police at 132 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(238) 260-8900 or after hours at +(238) 991-3325.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment may not be readily available. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. There is no hyperbaric/decompression chamber in the country for scuba divers. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Cabo Verde are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.   \nThe Department of State warns all U.S. citizens against taking any firearms or ammunition into Cabo Verde. If you are caught entering Cabo Verde with firearms or ammunitions, you may face severe penalties, including prison time. \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.

The country’s largest hospitals are in Praia and Mindelo. There are smaller public health centers and private medical clinics, of variable quality in both personnel and equipment, throughout the country. Transportation between islands is difficult, and inter-island medevac options are limited. The islands of Brava and Santo Antão do not have operational airports, which makes air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency difficult. \nThose traveling to Cabo Verde for scuba diving should be aware that there is no hyperbaric/decompression facility on the islands. \nAmbulance services are: \nWe do not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

On the islands of Santiago, Sal, and São Vicente, many urban and rural roads are asphalt. On other islands, some roads are narrow, winding, and mostly cobblestone.\nDuring the rainy season, cobblestone roads are especially slippery, and mud and rockslides are common on roads that cut through mountains. Roads and streets often are unlit and driving at night is hazardous.\nTraffic Laws :   Most accidents result from aggressive driving, speeding, passing on blind curves, and/or on inclines or declines in the rain.\nDriving while under the influence of alcohol is a serious problem in Cabo Verde and U.S. citizens could face severe penalties, including prison time, for driving under the influence. You are most likely to encounter a drunk driver on Sundays and at night. Exercise extreme caution toward both pedestrians and other drivers after celebrations, festivals, and open-air concerts as well as during holiday periods, such as Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and Carnival.\nPublic Transportation :   Praia has three principal modes of public transport: taxi, bus, and commuter vans. Using buses and vans is strongly discouraged. These vans may have a fixed, but flexible route and often contain more passengers than is safe. Licensed, registered taxis are clearly marked and tan/cream in color. While official taxis are considered safe and reliable, passengers should still exercise good common sense and avoid sharing a taxi with strangers.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Cabo Verde’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Cabo Verde’s air carrier operations.

Tourist and business visas are valid for one month from the date of entry into Cambodia.   Cambodia offers on-line visa processing . You may also apply in person at the Cambodian Embassy located at 4530 16th Street NW, Washington, DC 20011, tel. 202-726-7742, fax 202-726-8381.\nTourists, diplomats, and business travelers may also obtain a Cambodian visa at the airports in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and at all major border crossings. Cambodian immigration officials at airports now collect fingerprints upon entry using an inkless, electronic process. You will need a passport valid for a minimum of six months beyond the date of entry into Cambodia.\nIf you remain in Cambodia beyond the date of your authorized stay, Cambodian immigration officials will likely impose a fine of $10 per day overstayed. In cases of excessive overstays, you may be arrested for violating immigration laws and detained as you undergo official deportation proceedings at your own expense. Deportation from Cambodia may result in your being prohibited from reentering Cambodia in the future. You should contact the nearest Cambodian embassy or consulate, or visit the  Embassy of the Kingdom of Cambodia website  for the most current visa information.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Cambodia\nThe Department of State is concerned that individuals and groups may be planning terrorist actions against U.S. citizens and interests, including at sites frequented by Westerners in Southeast Asia. Extremist groups in Southeast Asia have transnational capabilities to carry out attacks against locations where Westerners congregate. Although the extremist threat in Cambodia is considered low and terrorist attacks are not common, U.S. citizens residing in, or traveling to, Cambodia should exercise caution in clubs, discos, bars, restaurants, hotels, places of worship, schools, outdoor recreation venues, tourist areas, beach resorts, and other places frequented by foreigners. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant with regard to their personal security and avoid ongoing police enforcement actions, crowds, and demonstrations. See Department of State’s  Worldwide Caution .\nLand mines and unexploded ordnance are found in remote rural areas throughout Cambodia, and especially in Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Siem Reap,  Kampong Thom, and Oddar Meanchey  provinces. Travelers in these regions should never walk in forested areas or even in dry rice paddies without a local guide. Areas around small bridges on secondary roads are particularly dangerous. Travelers should not touch anything that resembles a mine or unexploded ordnance; they should notify the Cambodia Mine Action Center at 012-800-473/023-995-437.\nCrime:  Cambodia has a critical crime rate, including street crime. Military weapons and explosives are readily available to criminals despite authorities’ efforts to collect and destroy such weapons. Armed robberies occur frequently, and foreign residents and visitors, including U.S. citizens, are among the victims. The Embassy has also received reports that residences and hotel rooms of U.S. citizens in Phnom Penh were burglarized while the occupants were asleep.\nThe most common type of theft is “snatch and grab” robbery, and anything that can be quickly grabbed is at risk: cameras, jewelry, purses, backpacks, mobile phones, etc. Exercise caution and keep belongings out of sight if you travel via “tuk-tuk,” as passengers in these open-air vehicles have been targeted by thieves. If walking along the street, make yourself less of a target by carrying bags or items in your hand or on the shoulder that is furthest from the street. If someone attempts to rob you, you should surrender your valuables immediately, since any perceived resistance may be met with physical violence, including lethal force. The U.S. Embassy has received reports of violent robberies escalating into fatalities. \nPickpockets, some who are masquerading as beggars, are present in the markets and at the tourist sites. Sometimes they may act overly friendly, placing their hand on your shoulder or back to distract you in order to pick your pocket.\nTo avoid the risk of theft or confiscation of original documents, the U.S. Embassy advises its personnel and all U.S. citizens traveling to, or residing in, Cambodia to carry photocopies of their U.S. passport, driver's license, and other important documents and to leave the originals in a hotel safe or other secure place. The U.S. Embassy advises citizens not to give their passport as collateral for motorcycle rentals, hotels, etc. Local police rarely investigate reports of crime against tourists, and travelers should not expect to recover stolen items. It has also been reported that some police stations charge foreigners between $20 and $100 to file a police report.\nForeigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of common scams targeting tourists,  often involving card games.  [MWP(P1] The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens being approached by individuals in public locations, such as popular shopping malls, and being invited to their homes where they end up participating in card games. These are often scams to steal tourists’ money. If you find yourself a victim of one of these scams, you should contact the U.S. Embassy.\nForeigners travelling to Cambodia should be aware of crime targeting tourists involving drugged drinks. The Embassy has received reports of U.S. citizens’ drinks being drugged at bars in order to incapacitate them for theft or sexual assault. Do not accept drinks from strangers and do not leave drinks unattended.\nThe U.S. Embassy advises citizens to be wary of scams involving individuals claiming they are in Cambodia and need financial assistance from the United States. The Embassy has determined that many of these requests are fraudulent and the individuals making the requests use false identities.  In the past year, numerous confirmed media reports of large-scale scam operations have led to a crackdown by Cambodian authorities. These operations have been reported to lure non-Cambodians with false promises of gainful employment. Victims of this false recruitment have then been made to participate in the online/phone-based financial confidence scams. \nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nThere have been numerous reports of visitors receiving fake or novelty $50 and $100 bills from ATM machines and banks across Cambodia. When receiving money from ATMs or bank tellers, you should count and examine the money while still in the presence of the ATM camera or bank teller. The fake money typically has a different feel than real U.S. currency and often has markings on the lower left that indicate it is for novelty purposes. If a suspicious bill is discovered, it should be shown to the ATM camera or teller, and the bank should be notified immediately.\nThe U.S. Embassy advises its personnel who travel to the provinces outside of Phnom Penh to exercise caution outside the provincial towns at all times. Many rural parts of the country remain without effective policing. Avoid walking alone after dusk anywhere in Sihanoukville, especially along the waterfront. You should be particularly vigilant during annual festivals and at tourist sites in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville, where there have been marked increases in motorcycle “snatch and grab” thefts of bags and purses.\nIf you are visiting Cambodia, you should practice sound personal security awareness by varying your routes and routines, maintaining a low profile, not carrying or displaying large amounts of cash, not wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, and not walking alone after dark. In addition, you should travel by automobile and not use local moto-taxis or cyclos (passenger-carrying bicycles). These vehicles are more vulnerable to armed robberies and offer no protection against injury when involved in traffic accidents.\nU.S. citizens are advised not to engage in  commercial surrogacy  arrangements in Cambodia. In October 2016, the Government of Cambodia issued an official proclamation banning commercial surrogacy in Cambodia. Please keep in mind that U.S. citizens and other foreigners in Cambodia are subject to Cambodian laws and procedures.\nAlthough gambling and casinos are legal in Cambodia, the U.S. Embassy strongly encourages all travelers to be cautious in choosing to visit casinos or related gambling centers in Cambodia. The U.S. Embassy is aware of numerous reported incidents at casinos throughout Cambodia. In the past year, these incidents such as fires at casinos resulting in multiple fatalities, violent assaults, murders, and suicides under suspicious circumstances have occurred.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at 023-728-000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nIn cases of sexual assault, U.S. citizen victims should contact the U.S. Embassy first  before contacting local police or authorities.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Cambodia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. If you break local laws in Cambodia, your U.S. passport won’t help you avoid arrest or prosecution.\nThe same rights and protections afforded those accused of a crime in the U.S. are not guaranteed in Cambodia, and the judicial process may be influenced by political, personal, and financial connections. In both the criminal and civil judicial systems, resources devoted to the investigation/discovery and trial process fall far below the standard expected in the United States. Cambodia routinely employs pre-trial detention for those charged with criminal offenses, sometimes for long periods of time before a trial is scheduled. Prison conditions in Cambodia are substandard and overcrowded, with little access to health care or basic nutritional requirements.\nU.S. citizens in Cambodia should be aware that there are limits to the assistance the Embassy can offer to those with concerns about due process or the fairness of their trial, as the Embassy is unable to interfere in the legal processes of a host country.\nYou can be prosecuted in the United States for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under that country’s laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods are illegal in the United States, and if you purchase them in a foreign country, you may be breaking local law as well.\nArrest Notifications:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  While there are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Cambodia, same sex marriage is not permitted. While Cambodians are relatively tolerant toward foreigners, LGB Cambodians routinely face discrimination and harassment, especially outside major urban areas. Public displays of affection are generally frowned upon for couples of any sexual orientation.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section six of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  While in Cambodia, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what they find in the United States. Currently, except for buildings and hotels that have been built under international standards, most public places and public transportation are not accessible. Persons with disabilities will face difficulties with Cambodia’s sidewalks, rest rooms, road crossings, and tourist areas.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  There have been reports of sexual assaults in the vicinity of drinking establishments and possible drugs being used to incapacitate female travelers. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nWater Festival:  During this annual festival, which takes place in November, the population in Phnom Penh increases significantly as millions of Cambodians from every town and province flock to the capital for three days. For personal safety and security, you should avoid crowded areas near the riverfront during the Water Festival holiday.\nCustoms:  Cambodian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Cambodia of items such as medications, firearms, antiquities, or ivory. It is advisable to contact the  Embassy of Cambodia  in Washington D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements.\nRestrictions on Freedom of Expression and Association:  There are freedom of speech restrictions in Cambodia. Anyone who criticizes or insults the King by any means could face between one to five years in prison. This ban includes insults or criticism made online and via social media. The government of Cambodia has used libel and slander laws to restrict public discussion on topics it deems sensitive or against its interests.\nDual Nationality:  Dual nationality is allowed under Cambodia's 1996 nationality law. However, if you have Cambodian nationality and possess another nationality, you may be viewed as a Cambodian citizen in any court proceedings and face stricter sentences.\nBusiness Transactions:  Some U.S. citizens have reported threats of personal injury, extortion, detention, or kidnapping related to personal business disputes, in particular those involving real estate. If you are planning to engage in real estate or other significant financial transactions, please proceed with caution and retain the appropriate legal counsel.\nFinancial Transaction:  The U.S. dollar is widely used, especially for larger transactions, and most prices are quoted in dollars. Ripped, torn, or stained U.S. bills are not accepted. Authorities encourage greater use of the Cambodian riel, but it is less favored and is mostly given to tourists as change for dollar purchases. The riel is commonly used in smaller towns and rural areas. Credit cards are accepted at some establishments within Cambodia, and a number of banks in Phnom Penh accept credit cards for cash advances. Credit cards are often subject to a service charge. Banks and major hotels accept travelers' checks but usually charge a service fee. Several international banks operate ATM machines that allow travelers to obtain U.S. dollar currency in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and other urban centers. Personal checks are not generally accepted. Several banks serve as Western Union agents, to which funds can be wired, including in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and other provincial cities. Information on Western Union can be found at their  website .\nPhotography:  Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest — including government buildings, military installations, airfields, and bridges — may result in problems with the authorities and confiscation of your camera.\nMedical facilities and services in Cambodia do not meet international standards. Both Phnom Penh and Siem Reap have a limited number of internationally run clinics and hospitals that can provide basic medical care and stabilization. Medical care outside of these two cities is almost non-existent. Local pharmacies provide a limited supply of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Because the quality of locally obtained medications can vary greatly, make sure to bring a supply of your medications adequate for the duration of your stay in Cambodia. You should be wary of purchasing local medication. Counterfeit medication is readily available, often indiscernible from authentic medication, and potentially lethal.\n Be aware that neither U.S. Medicare nor Medicaid apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on what type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\n  Supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation is strongly recommended.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of  Cambodia   to ensure the medication is legal in Cambodia. Always, carry your prescription medication in the original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\nBe careful if purchasing off-brand medication from pharmacies in Cambodia. Drugs sold in pharmacies can be fake and possibly dangerous. \nMalaria, Dengue and Tuberculosis are serious health concerns in Cambodia. For further information, please consult the  CDC .\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nRoad Condition and Safety:  You should not drive at night in Cambodia outside of city limits. Roads between major areas are adequate; however, roads leading to rural areas are poor. During the rainy season, road conditions deteriorate considerably, and roadside assistance is non-existent. Cambodian drivers routinely ignore traffic laws and vehicles are poorly maintained. Intoxicated drivers are commonplace, particularly during the evening hours. Travel is recommended in daylight between the hours of 6:30  a.m. and 5:30 p.m.  There are also frequent bus accidents.  \n  \nSerious flooding occurs throughout Cambodia from June through November. Travel on unpaved or dirt roads is difficult after heavy rainfall.  The National Route highways are the only roads that can be traveled, with caution, during this time of the year.\nTraffic Laws:  In the event you are in a traffic accident, you should cooperate with the police. You should also contact your insurance company for guidance in dealing with the other party and the police. To avoid the risk of theft or confiscation of original documents, the U.S. Embassy advises its personnel and all U.S. citizens traveling to, or residing in, Cambodia to carry photocopies of their U.S. passport, driver's license, and other important documents and to leave the originals in a hotel safe or other secure place.\nWhile in Cambodia, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Traffic in Cambodia is composed of a mix of automobiles, commercial trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and tuk tuks. As a result of poor roads, driver intoxication, and disregard for traffic laws, traffic accidents are a common occurrence. You should exercise great caution in moving through the country, regardless of mode of transportation.\nPublic Transportation:  Travelers should exercise caution when using inter-city buses, including those to popular tourist destinations such as Siem Reap and Sihanoukville. Despite the wide availability of moto-taxis, you should not use them due to safety concerns. Be vigilant if traveling by “tuk-tuk” or “cyclo” as personal belongings can be easily stolen. Organized emergency services for victims of traffic accidents are non-existent outside of major urban areas, and those available in major urban areas are inadequate.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of Cambodia’s  national tourist office   and national authority responsible for  road safety .\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Cambodia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Cambodia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on  the FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Cambodia ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Cambodia. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Cambodia should exercise increased caution.\nMariners planning travel to Cambodia should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at  Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI) Web Portal | MARAD (dot.gov) . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings website  (select “broadcast warnings”)."

Visit the  Embassy of Cameroon  website for the most current visa information.\nDual Nationality:  Cameroon does not recognize dual nationality. U.S. citizens should always present themselves as U.S. citizens to Cameroonian authorities, regardless of their country of birth. U.S. citizens must always enter and exit Cameroon on a U.S. passport with a valid Cameroonian visa otherwise they are liable to be denied entry or detained. Furthermore, presenting oneself as a Cameroonian citizen may impede our ability to provide consular services.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents of Cameroon.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nBoko Haram and ISIS-West Africa are active in Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon. Suicide bombings have occurred in public places in and around urban areas resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Terrorist attacks are most common outside major towns, especially in the regions bordering  Nigeria  and  Chad . Extremists have frequently target areas of congregation, particularly camps for refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). While most victims of terrorist attacks in Cameroon have been locals, violent extremist organizations may seek to target Westerners or conduct other high-profile operations. Kidnapping by terrorist organizations remains a concern. Refrain from traveling outside of cities or towns after dark and exercise caution when in the vicinity of potential targets.\nThere is ongoing violence in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security force operations and attacks by armed militants regularly take place throughout these Regions including in major cities. Neighboring areas of other regions are at risk of spillover violence, including Douala. Use of improvised explosives and incendiary devices, kidnappings, illegitimate detentions, and acts of violent criminality by armed actors have also occurred in Northwest and Southwest Cameroon. Security forces, government officials, road travelers, administrative buildings, schools, and commercial areas have been repeatedly attacked. Those suspected of being associated, even tangentially, with the central government or armed militants have been targeted for reprisals by a variety of elements.\nBorder Areas : Cameroon’s borders remain porous. Terrorists regularly cross the border into Cameroon from Nigeria and Chad to conduct attacks in the Far North, North, and Adamawa Regions. Militant activities and security operations routinely occur along Cameroon’s shared border with Nigeria in the Northwest and Southwest Regions. Armed criminals and communal militia frequently conduct attacks in border areas abutting the  Central African Republic   (CAR).\nEmbassy personnel are restricted from traveling to the Northwest, Southwest, North, and Far North Regions of Cameroon, as well as within 20 kilometers of the border with the Central African Republic in Adamawa and East Regions, and within 20 kilometers of the border with Nigeria and north of Ngaoudere in the Adamawa Region.\nBakassi Peninsula:  Cameroon's military authorities restrict access to the Bakassi Peninsula. U.S. citizens should avoid this area.\nUse of Improvised Explosive Devices : Multiple improvised explosive device (IED) attacks have occurred in Douala and Yaoundé since June 2020. The threat for similar attacks could take place countrywide. Various armed actors, to include terrorists and political militants, may use such devices. To date, recent IED incidents have not directly targeted U.S. citizens or areas frequented by Westerners, however the risk of wrong place/wrong time violence remains. Locations with a high security force or government presence may be at increased risk of being targeted.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:  Violent and opportunistic crime is prevalent throughout the country including major cities. Foreigners in Cameroon have been victims of all types of crime including murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, carjacking, burglary, theft, armed robbery, and home invasion. Criminals often employ violence, particularly in instances where victims attempt to resist. The risk of street and residential crime is especially high, even in affluent areas with a large police and private security presence.\nTransport Crimes:   U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from using taxis.  Violent assaults on taxi passengers are common. Petty theft is prevalent, particularly on trains, buses, and taxis.\nThe Hilton and Mont Febe hotels offer a shuttle service from Yaoundé-Nsimalen Airport to downtown Yaoundé. Travelers are encouraged to use this service or retain the services of a reputable private transport company.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nMaritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery continue to increase throughout the Gulf of Guinea including Cameroon’s waters. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property are common and may occur near coastal areas or deep waters. More information on current conditions may be found on the  Office of Naval Intelligence’s piracy page.\nCommunications:  During periods of heightened unrest or insecurity, there is a heightened risk of communications disruptions which may affect internet access, social media, mobile messaging, and cellular voice calls. These disruptions may be localized or countrywide.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI   pages for information.\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by calling 117 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (237) 22220-1500. Dial + (237) 22222-2525 in Yaoundé or dial 112 in major cities to contact ambulance services. If you have been a victim of sexual assault or rape, consider contacting a medical provider for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nVictims of Crime:   Tourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in Douala and Yaoundé. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of these two cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nYou may be taken in for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification, travel permit, or Cameroonian driver’s license.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice website.\nPhotography:  It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations, and other public facilities, many of which are unmarked. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, or be detained or arrested. Do not take photos of people without their permission.\nArrest Notification:   If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our  webpage  for further information.\nPhone Service:  Cellular phones are the norm, as other telephone service is unreliable and landlines are nearly non-existent. It may be possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone. You will need to show your passport.\nCurrency:  The Central African franc (XAF) is the official currency of Cameroon, but U.S. dollars and Euros are accepted in urban areas. Cameroon is primarily a cash economy. Due to the potential for fraud and other criminal activity, avoid using credit cards and be cautious when using ATMs. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. Money transfer services are found throughout the country.\nCustoms:  Strict import and export regulations, particularly with regard to pharmaceuticals and wood products, are enforced. It is illegal to buy, sell, kill, or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a license, including ivory. Cameroon is a signatory to the  Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.  You will be prosecuted and could receive a prison sentence or a fine if you buy or traffic in these goods.\nWild Animal Parks:  Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Use common sense and maintain a safe distance around wildlife. Even in the most serene settings, wild animals pose a lethal threat. There have been reports of armed poachers attacking tourists.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal and punishable by a prison sentence of six months to five years and a fine ranging from 20,000 to 200,000 CFA francs ($35-$353). LGB individuals face social stigmatization, harassment, and discrimination. Police and civilians may extort money from presumed LGB individuals with the threat of exposure or arrest. Suspected members of the LGB community have received anonymous threats by phone, text, and email.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report   for further details.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in Cameroon, dial the number of the hospital in the area where you are located. There is currently no national number for general health-related emergencies in the country.\nAmbulance services are:\nInjured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:   Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of Cameroon to ensure the medication is legal in Cameroon.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals available on  this page  under \"local resources.\" We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\nPharmaceuticals\nNon-Traditional Medicine\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy\nWater Quality\nGeneral Health Language\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nAir Quality\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Cameroon's roads networks are poorly maintained and not well lit. During the rainy season from April to November, many roads are not passable even with four-wheel-drive vehicles. Traffic safety is hazardous due to lack of traffic signs, poorly trained/disciplined drivers, inadequately maintained vehicles, and indifference among many drivers toward the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. Other driving risks include excessive speed, erratic driving habits, lack of vehicle maintenance, and pedestrians, wildlife, and livestock.\nOutside of major cities, travel with extra fuel, food, and water, as well as a reliable means of communication, such as a satellite phone or radio, as mobile phone coverage is limited. Professional roadside assistance service is not available.\nRoadblocks:  Security forces stop motorists on the pretext of minor or non-existent violations to conduct vehicle searches and check passengers for identity papers. They may also extort bribes. We advise travelers not to pay bribes, and to ask the police officer to provide a citation to be paid at the local court.\nTo protect yourself:\nTraffic Laws:   Cameroonian law does not require an international driver’s license. A valid driver’s license from any U.S. state or territory is valid to drive in Cameroon for stays of less than three months.\nAccidents:  Accidental injury due to hazardous road conditions is a major threat to health and safety.   In the event of an automobile accident, remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. Although it is illegal to move your vehicle before the police arrive, if a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid all travel by public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Any form of public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. Mini-buses, buses, trains, and ferries are in poor mechanical condition and are often filled well beyond their intended capacity. Make sure any car you hire is adequately insured, preferably by written confirmation from the insurance company (rather than the car hire firm). If you are hiring a driver and car, make sure you are not liable for any accident or damage.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Cameroon, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Cameroon’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Cameroon should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .

Excessive speed, erratic driving habits, and chronic lack of road signs make driving dangerous. Street lighting is limited, and it is difficult to see pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchairs, and animals at night.\nOther risks include:\nTo mitigate the threat of roadside crime or becoming stuck in sand/mud when driving outside of N’Djamena, travel in daylight hours only.\nCarry:\nTraffic Laws : An international driving permit is required. Use of cell phones while driving and/or driving a vehicle with tinted windows is illegal.\nRoadblocks : Security forces set up spontaneous roadblocks in and around N’Djamena, especially after dark, to conduct vehicle searches and check passengers for identity papers. They may also solicit bribes and require drivers to submit to pat-down body searches.\nAccidents : Remain inside the vehicle, and call for police. Although it is illegal to move your vehicle before police arrive, if a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident.\nPublic Transportation : Public transportation is not recommended for tourists. Privately operated minibuses are often not properly maintained and dangerous. Although taxis are available throughout N’Djamena, they are unsafe and should not be used. Hire private transport from reliable sources; travel agencies and local hotels may also be able to arrange private transport for you.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Chad, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards.

You do not need a visa for a tourist or business stay of 90 days or fewer (if traveling on a tourist passport). Upon arrival, you will receive a Tourist Card (Tarjeta de Turismo) valid for up to 90 days, which you can extend for another 90-day period by paying $100 US at the  Chilean Immigration Office . You must return the Tourist Card upon departure. Failure to return it may delay your departure from Chile. If the Tourist Card is lost or stolen, you must replace it at an  International Police Office  or at the airport before leaving. You will face a fine if you remain longer than allowed, and you will not be able to leave Chile until the fine is paid. If applicable, pay the fine before your departure by going to the  Chilean Immigration Office  or you may face significant delays. \nTravel on Diplomatic or Official Passports:   U.S. citizens traveling to or through Chile on diplomatic or official passports are required to obtain a visa before travel.\nEntry / Exit Requirements for Dual Nationals:  Dual nationals must enter and exit Chile using their Chilean passports, and they must enter and exit the United States using their U.S. passports.\nEntry / Exit Requirements for Minors (under 18):  Parents traveling with a minor must show evidence of their relationship to the child when entering or departing the country. Carry an original apostilled birth certificate.\nMinors departing Chile must submit to Chilean airport officials an original notarized authorization from any non-traveling parent(s), a photocopy of the authorization, and an original apostilled birth certificate at the time of departure. For non-traveling parent(s) in Chile, the notarization can be done by a local Chilean notary public. For non-traveling parent(s) in the United States, the notarization can be done at the  Chilean Embassy or a Chilean Consulate . If a U.S. notary executes the authorization, it must be  apostilled  to be valid in Chile. An apostille should be obtained well in advance of travel as the process is lengthy.\nDemonstrations occur frequently, especially on March 29, May 1 and 21, September 11, and October 18. Although most are peaceful, they can become violent. Avoid demonstrations if possible. Strikes are also common and can cause significant travel delays, especially if you are traveling to remote areas, such as Easter Island, Punta Arenas, or Chiloe.\nAnarchist groups have placed explosive and incendiary devices in public spaces throughout Santiago, such as ATMs, metro stations, and government facilities. Remain vigilant and avoid suspicious or unattended packages.\nAraucanía Conflict:  Some individuals or groups claiming affiliation with the Mapuche indigenous community have sought redress for grievances by burning churches, homes, and pastures, and attacking trucks, buses, and farming/logging equipment, causing property destruction, injuries, and deaths. In 2022, the Government of Chile implemented a State of Emergency in the area that is reevaluated every 15 days. While these groups have mainly targeted forestry corporations and landowners, you should exercise caution in the Araucanía region.\nCrime:  Street crime, carjackings, telephone scams, credit card fraud, and residential break-ins are common, especially in Santiago, Valparaiso, Viña del Mar, Antofagasta, Calama, and Iquique. Exercise significant caution when touring Cerro Santa Lucia, Cerro San Cristobal, Mercado Central, Plaza de Armas, Bellavista, Yungay, Barrio Lastarria, Persa BioBio, Barrio Meiggs, Patronato, Centro Cultural Estación Mapocho and Los Dominicos in Santiago, or other popular tourist sites as pickpocketing and muggings occur frequently. Small bags and purses have been stolen from hotel lobbies, crowded tourist locations, Santiago’s subway, taxis, and the backs of chairs and floors at bars, restaurants, and cafés. Cell phones are often stolen from restaurant tables. Criminals have drugged and robbed U.S. citizens, leaving them with no memory of events. The murder of a U.S. citizen occurred in 2023 in the neighborhood of Yungay. Carjackings and vehicle thefts are a serious problem in Santiago, Valparaiso, and northern Chile (from Iquique to Arica). Thieves have punctured rental car tires to distract foreigners and steal their belongings from the vehicle.\nAdditionally, though not typical touring areas, exercise significant caution when traveling through or in Villa Francia, El Castillo, La Victoria, La Pincoya, Bajos de Mena y Mahuidanche, and the municipalities of Cerro Navia, Pudahuel, Quilicura and San Bernardo in Santiago,\nIn particular:\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at 133 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(56) 2 2330-3716. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance or call local police at 149.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules about best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand to support organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\nSee our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, visit our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice   website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nSpecial Circumstances:  Chile is prone to major earthquakes, wildfires, landslides, tsunamis, floods, and volcanic eruptions. The Chilean National Disaster Prevention and Response Service ( SENAPRED ) provides alerts and guidance for these types of events. There are emergency preparedness guides available on the  Ready.gov  and Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) websites. It is important to make a plan and to keep emergency supplies accessible. There are recommendations for preparing a disaster supply kit available  here .\nCitizens are advised to consult with authorities and/or hotel management if in doubt of the need to leave an area. All U.S. citizens are encouraged to monitor the news closely, including the  SENAPRED website.\nThere are minefields on Chile's border with Peru and Bolivia, and Argentina in Patagonia. Follow clearly identified roads and trails when in minefield areas. Consult with national park or other local officials concerning minefields.\nFor outdoor and adventure sports along the border with Argentina, Bolivia or Peru, register with Chile’s  Dirección Nacional de Fronteras y Limites del Estado , which can provide a permit allowing travelers to temporarily cross borders to engage in outdoor activities.\nDespite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting persons lost or injured in isolated and wilderness areas is difficult. You should only undertake organized adventure activities with a well-established and insured company. If you intend to hike, never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company. Inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to return. Register with park officials, when available, or the nearest police station when pursuing outdoor activities in remote areas. Obtain detailed information on hiking trails before setting out and do not venture off marked trails. Distances between centers for outdoor sports and top-notch hospital care can be extreme. You should consider getting medical evacuation insurance.\nBefore you go, consult:\nUnder Chilean law, you can be expelled from the country for damaging national heritage objects or places. Travelers should learn and adhere to all the rules of visiting national parks.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on adult same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Chile. Since 2022, under Law 21400, same-sex marriage is legal in Chile. There have been cases of discrimination due to sexual orientation including cases involving violence or death. Laws also prevent those who do not conform with their assigned sex at birth from changing sex markers on government-issued identity documents.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Many public places and transportation are not adapted to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities. For information on handicap accessible locations in Santiago and other locations, visit the Chilean  National Disability Agency  or  MapCity.com\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers\nMedical care in Chile is generally good, though it may not meet U.S. standards in remote areas. Major hospitals accept credit cards. Santiago has one private hospital accredited by The American Hospital Association:  Clinica Alemana . \nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information insurance coverage overseas. We strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of  Chile  to ensure the medication is legal in Chile. Always carry a sufficient supply of your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\nPlease note the following health concerns:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Driving in Chile is relatively safe; road conditions vary from well-paved to gravel and dirt roads in more remote areas. Roadside assistance is widely available with local insurance. In the more remote parts of Chile, roadside assistance and gas stations may be limited; travel with at least one spare tire and extra fuel. Yellow reflective vests are required in all cars in case of a roadside emergency. Vehicular inspections are required yearly to renew your mandatory car insurance.\nTraffic Laws:  Driving under the influence of alcohol in Chile is severely punished and can result in incarceration. While in Chile, you may encounter road conditions and traffic laws that differ significantly from those in the United States:\nPublic Transportation:  Taxis and public transportation are generally safe, plentiful, and relatively inexpensive. Ride-share applications and taxis with orange and yellow license plates are generally safe to use. Avoid using unmetered taxis and unauthorized services outside of airports. Use of unauthorized taxi services has resulted in theft. Chile’s Ministry of Transportation maintains a list of  registered taxi companies . To use the public bus system in Santiago, you need to obtain the prepaid “BIP” card, which can also be used on the Santiago  subway .\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Chile’s Civil Aviation Authority as in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Chile’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Chile should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts on the  Maritime Administration  website. Information may also be posted to the websites of the  U.S. Coast Guard  and the  National Geospace Intelligence Agency  (select “broadcast warnings”)."

This is different from a PRC visa. Special permits can often be obtained through a travel agent in the PRC. To learn more about entry requirements for the TAR or other restricted areas, check with the  Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America .\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to help if you encounter problems in the TAR. The PRC government does not usually allow U.S. government personnel to travel there, even to provide consular assistance to U.S. citizens.\nHIV/AIDS: \n  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of the PRC.\nVisa-Free Travel to Hainan : \nCitizens of the United States and certain other countries can enter the province of Hainan visa-free for up to 30 days for tourism, temporary commercial and trade activities, medical treatment, exhibitions and sports competitions, but excluding work and study. Travelers must arrive by direct international flight or via Hong Kong or Macau.\nTransiting the PRC:\nDuring Your Stay: \nDual Nationality: The PRC government does not recognize dual nationality.  If you are a citizen of both the United States and the PRC and you enter the PRC on a PRC passport, Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents, or other PRC-issued travel document, local authorities will assert that you are a PRC citizen only and refuse to recognize you as a U.S. citizen. U.S. citizens with ethnic or historical ties to China may also be considered PRC nationals by local authorities. This could limit your ability to access certain consular services. For example, if you are detained, local officials could deny access to U.S. consular officials and assistance. \n \nDual U.S.-PRC citizens may encounter challenges when seeking public benefits in the PRC. This can include enrolling in public schools, getting treatment at public hospitals and clinics, or obtaining PRC identity and citizenship documents, such as passports. The U.S. government may be unable to assist U.S.-PRC dual citizens in overcoming these challenges or navigating other consequences of PRC nationality. The PRC government may inconsistently apply interpretations of dual nationality.\nIf you are a naturalized U.S. citizen or have a possible claim to PRC citizenship, and you are traveling to the PRC, inform yourself about PRC nationality law and practices relating to determination and loss of PRC citizenship. PRC authorities generally consider a child born in the PRC to at least one PRC-national parent to be a PRC citizen, even if the child was issued a U.S. passport at the time of birth. If you have or had a claim to PRC citizenship and your child is born in the PRC, prior to departing the PRC with your child, you may wish to contact the local Public Security Bureau and/or Entry-Exit Bureau for information on obtaining a travel document. If you have or had a claim to PRC citizenship and your child is born in the United States, please contact the  Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America  for specific information on the documentation requirements to bring your child to the PRC.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nMost visitors to the PRC will not encounter safety concerns. Traffic accidents are the most common safety concern for U.S. citizens. Training, capability, and responsiveness of PRC authorities vary by region and even within cities. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General may not represent U.S. citizens in either criminal or civil legal matters. They have no law enforcement authority in the PRC.\nTo ensure your safety and security in the PRC, you should:\nViolent crime is not common in the PRC, however:\nBe alert to potential criminal schemes, such as:\nBe alert to potential criminal schemes. These can include: internet, phone scams, dating scams, and financial scams. If you are the victim of a scam, record as many details as possible, including names, telephone and bank numbers, and email and IP addresses. Then, file a police report, and inform the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General. \nSee the  U.S. Department of State's  and the  U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s  pages for information on scams. \n  \n  Victims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate General. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault can contact the local police and should contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime. \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . \nWe can: \nLost or Stolen Passports:  If your passport is stolen, you must apply for both a new passport at the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General and a new PRC visa. File a police report at the nearest police station right away. You may also be directed to file a report at the local  Exit-Entry Bureau .\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General for assistance. Domestic violence in the PRC is rarely recognized as a crime.\nTourism:  The tourism industry in the PRC is unevenly regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the PRC government or by recognized authorities. If you are seriously injured, sophisticated medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders may be slower to respond in rural areas,  potentially delaying access to urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  \nSee our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:   You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\nSome laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. See  crimes against minors abroad  and the  U.S. Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General immediately.\nThe PRC legal system can be opaque and the interpretation and enforcement of local laws arbitrary. The judiciary does not enjoy independence from political influence. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in the PRC should be aware of varying levels of scrutiny to which they will be subject from local law enforcement and state security. \nCertain provisions of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China, such as “social order” crimes (Article 293) and crimes involving “endangering state security” and “state secrets” (Article 102 to 113), are ill-defined and can be interpreted by the authorities arbitrarily and situationally. Information that may be common knowledge in other countries could be considered a “state secret” in the PRC, and information can be designated a “state secret” retroactively. \n \n Drug and Alcohol Enforcement:\nPRC law-enforcement authorities have little tolerance for illegal drugs, including marijuana. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in the PRC are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, or the death penalty. Police regularly conduct unannounced drug tests on people suspected of drug use and have been known to enter a bar or nightclub and subject all patrons to immediate drug testing. Police may force you to provide a urine, blood, or hair follicle sample on short notice. A positive finding, even if the drug was legal elsewhere or consumed prior to arriving in the PRC, can lead to immediate detention, fines, deportation, and/or a ban from re-entering the PRC.\nThe PRC also has strict laws against driving under the influence of alcohol that can lead to immediate detention on a criminal charge.\nAssisted Reproductive Technology:  In vitro fertilization (IVF) is widely and legally practiced. PRC law, however, strictly forbids surrogacy, and surrogacy contracts will not be considered valid. The use of reproductive technology for medical research and profit is strictly controlled. \n \n Contracts and Commercial Disputes:  Before entering into a commercial or employment contract in the PRC, have it reviewed by legal counsel both in the United States and in the PRC. The  U.S. International Trade Administration  can assist you in identifying and vetting business contacts and opportunities but may not intervene in contract disputes. Many U.S. citizens have reported difficulty getting their contracts enforced by PRC courts or being forced out of profitable joint-ventures without opportunity to secure legal recourse in the PRC. \n \n Counterfeit Goods:  Do not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. Bootlegs are illegal in the United States, and you may also be breaking local law by purchasing them.\nCruise Ship Passengers:  Click here for  safety information and travel advice .\nDigital Payments:  The PRC has transitioned to almost a predominantly cashless society. Some mobile phone applications offer a digital payment solution for individuals visiting the PRC on a temporary or long-term basis. Often, payment is made through an individual using their mobile phone to scan a vendor or business’s QR code. The number of locations accepting foreign credit cards has decreased in recent years. Visitors to the PRC should research whether the locations they are visiting will accept foreign credit cards and familiarize themselves with mobile digital payment options prior to traveling to the PRC.\nEarthquakes:  Earthquakes occur throughout the PRC. Check  here  for information about preparing for a crisis or disaster overseas.\nEnglish/Secondary School Teachers:  English teachers in the PRC frequently report employment disputes which can result in questioning by local authorities, termination, lost wages, confiscation of passports, forced eviction from housing, and even threats of violence.\nExit Bans:  Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may result in an exit ban which will prohibit your departure from the PRC until the issue is resolved. Even individuals and their family members who are not directly involved, or even aware of these proceedings, can be subject to an exit ban. Additionally, some local businesspeople who feel that they have been wronged by a foreign business partner may hire \"debt collectors” to harass, intimidate, and sometimes physically detain foreign business partners or family members in hopes of collecting the debt. The U.S. Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate General can provide a list of local attorneys who serve U.S. clients but are otherwise unable to intervene in civil cases. Local law enforcement authorities are generally unwilling to become involved in what they consider private business matters and may not provide the individual who has been barred from leaving the PRC with any written notice of the exit ban.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Same sex marriages are not legally recognized in the PRC and local authorities will not provide marriage certificates to same-sex couples. There are no civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination or harassment based on sexual orientation though homosexuality has been decriminalized. Prejudices and discrimination still exist in many parts of the country. There are growing LGB communities in some of the largest cities in the PRC and violence against LGB individuals in the PRC is relatively rare. See  Section 6 of our Human Rights Practices in the Human Rights Report for the People's Republic of China  and read our  LGB Travel Information page .\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):  In January 2017, the PRC implemented a law regulating the operations of foreign NGOs in the PRC. NGOs and their employees should ensure they are complying with all relevant statutory requirements, particularly if working in sensitive areas or fields. Additionally, the PRC government announced sanctions on five U.S.-based NGOs in December 2019.\nNorth Korea:  Do not travel to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention of U.S. nationals. For further information, consult the  North Korea International Travel Information page  and the  North Korea Travel Advisory .\nPolitical and Religious Activity:  Participating in unauthorized political or religious activities, including participating in public protests or sending private electronic messages critical of the government   may result in detention and PRC government-imposed restrictions on future travel to the PRC. Although the PRC constitution permits freedom of religious belief, it does not permit freedom of religious practice and government officials are increasing pressure on domestic religious activities. The U.S. Mission to the PRC has observed an increase in the number of U.S. citizens being interrogated, detained, and/or forced to leave the country in connection with real or perceived religious proselytization. U.S. citizens have been detained and/or expelled for distributing religious literature, including Bibles, or engaging in unauthorized religious meetings. If you bring religious literature with you, local law dictates that it be a “reasonable amount” for your personal use. If you attempt to bring larger quantities, the literature will likely be confiscated and you may be fined, detained, or deported. \n \n Social Insurance:  The PRC has a social insurance system to which foreigners who work in the PRC must contribute. When you sign an employment contract, you must apply for a social insurance number, and it is important that your employer work with you to comply with the regulations. Please check the official  website  for updated information. \n \n Social Media:  Social media accounts are widely monitored in the PRC. Local authorities may use information they deem critical, controversial, or that might involve illegal activity against both the poster of the material and the host of the social media forum under local law. Individuals have also been held responsible for the content that others place within social media spaces they control, such as the comments section under a post or within a group chat that an individual controls.\nSpecial Scrutiny of Foreign Citizens:  On occasion, U.S. citizens visiting or resident in the PRC have been interrogated or detained for reasons said to be related to “state security.” In such circumstances, you could face arrest, detention, or an exit ban prohibiting your departure from the PRC for a prolonged period. Dual U.S.-PRC nationals and U.S. citizens of Chinese heritage may be at a higher risk of facing such special scrutiny. Information about  dual nationality  can be found on our website. \n \n Students:  See our  U.S. Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nSurveillance and Monitoring:  Security personnel carefully watch foreign visitors and may place you under surveillance. Hotel rooms (including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet usage, ​digital payments, and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without your consent or knowledge. Security personnel have been known to detain and deport U.S. citizens sending private electronic messages critical of the PRC government. \n \n Transferring Money to/from the PRC:  The regulatory environment in the PRC includes tightening capital outflow controls that can severely impact one’s ability to move money out of the country. Wire transfers may only be available to those who have an active bank account in the PRC. Ask your local bank location in the PRC for more information. The U.S. Department of State may be able to help transfer funds to a destitute U.S citizen overseas through our office in Washington, D.C., to a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General abroad. More information on this option is available  here .\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  U.S. citizens with mobility disabilities may face challenges while traveling in the PRC. Sidewalks often do not have curb cuts and many streets can be crossed only via pedestrian bridges or underpasses accessible by staircase. Assistive technologies for blind people and those with other vision disabilities are unreliable, and access to elevators in public buildings can be restricted. In major cities, public restrooms in places visited by tourists usually have a least one accessible toilet. See  Persons with Disabilities in the Human Rights Report for the People's Republic of China (2022) .\nTyphoons:  The southeast coast of the PRC is subject to strong typhoons and tropical storms, usually from July through September. For current information, please consult the  Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu  and the  National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center . \n \n Women Travelers:  If you are a woman traveling abroad, please review our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nXinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region:  Extraordinary security measures are in place through the region. Authorities may impose curfews and restrictions on short notice. They may also engage in invasive surveillance techniques against individuals. Expect significant travel delays, avoid gatherings and demonstrations, always carry ID, and follow the instructions of local authorities. Travelers with ethnic ties to the region may experience special restrictions, discrimination, and even arbitrary detention.\nQuality of Care:  The standards of medical care in the PRC are not equivalent to those in the United States. Even in private hospitals or public hospitals with well-equipped wards, English-speaking patients frequently encounter difficulty due to cultural, language, and regulatory differences. Rural areas may have less developed facilities and inadequate staffing. Additionally, Rh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain; the blood type of the general Asian populace is Rh positive. \n \n Payment and Insurance:  Ambulances in the PRC are often slow to arrive. Many do not have sophisticated medical equipment or trained responders. Payment in cash or via mobile payment app for services is often required prior to treatment, including emergency cases. Travelers will be asked to pay a deposit prior to admission to cover the expected cost of treatment. Hospitals in major cities may accept foreign credit cards. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in the PRC maintain lists of local  English-speaking doctors and hospitals . \n \n The U.S. Government does not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. You must provide payment and seek reimbursement.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Public hospitals require pre-payment for services before providing treatment to foreigners. Most care providers in the PRC only accept payments in cash or via local mobile payment apps. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nMedication:  If traveling with prescription medication, make sure the medication is legal in the PRC by checking with the  Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America . Carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with the prescription. Many commonly used U.S. drugs and medications are not available in the PRC, and counterfeit, low-quality knockoffs are prevalent. If you have medications sent to you from outside the PRC, customs authorities may confiscate them, or you may have to pay high customs duties. \n \n Air Quality:  Air pollution is a significant problem in many locations. Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. The PRC’s  Ministry of Ecology and Environment  also provides its own air quality data for cities throughout the PRC. \n \nMost roads and towns in Tibet, Qinghai, parts of Xinjiang, and western Sichuan are situated at altitudes over 10,000 feet. Take appropriate precautions to prepare for and be alert to altitude sickness. \n \n Disease:  The following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all routine  vaccinations  recommended by the CDC. The CDC  traveler’s health site for the PRC  provides vaccine recommendations specific to travel within the PRC.\nFor further health information :\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic safety is generally poor, and driving can be dangerous. Rules, regulations, and conditions vary greatly throughout the PRC.\nTraffic can be chaotic and largely unregulated outside of major metropolitan areas. The rate of accidents, including fatal accidents, is among the highest in the world. Motorcycle and bicycle accidents are frequent and often deadly. Pedestrians do not have the right of way in the PRC. Be extremely cautious when walking in traffic, even in marked crosswalks when the walk light is green. Child safety seats are not widely available.\nTraffic Laws:\nPlease refer to our  Road Safety page  for more information. Also, please review the  Law of the People's Republic of China on Road Traffic Safety .\nPublic Transportation:  Subways, trains, and buses are generally safe. Public transportation is widely available in major cities, although individuals on crowded buses and subways can be targeted by pickpockets. \n \n Aviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the PRC government’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of the PRC’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s Safety Assessment Page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to the PRC should check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts  at the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Security Communications with Industry (MSCI) web portal. More information may be available on the  U.S. Coast Guard Homeport website , and the  U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Navigational Warnings website .\nThe Commandant of the Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in PRC ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108."

Persons who are both U.S. and Colombian citizens MUST travel between these countries with both passports, presenting the Colombian passport upon departing Colombia and the U.S. passport upon arrival in the United States. \nAdditional Exit Requirements for Minors:   To prevent international child abduction, Colombia has implemented special exit procedures for Colombian children under 18 (including dual nationals) who depart the country alone, without both parents, or without a legal guardian.  For detailed information regarding exit requirements for minors with Colombian nationality please visit  Migración Colombia's website  (in Spanish only).\nLost or Stolen Passport:  If your U.S. passport is lost or stolen in Colombia, you must  obtain a new  one before leaving the country. You can report the loss or theft on the Colombian National Police  website .\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Colombia.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism : Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nTerrorist groups and criminal organizations continue operating and carrying out attacks in Colombia.  \nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime : Crimes and scams against tourists, and those perceived to be wealthy, are common and well-coordinated in urban areas, including in affluent neighborhoods. Firearms and knives are prevalent in Colombia and often used in muggings and robberies under the threat of violence. Drive-by motorcyclist snatchings of cell phones, bags, and valuables are extremely common. Victims are often identified well in advance of the robbery based on visible jewelry, high value wristwatches, and general attire while in public places such as shopping malls, restaurants, and airports.  \nNarco-trafficking groups, including the Clan del Golfo frequently engage in violence against civilians and security forces. \nDating App Robberies/Drugging/Homicides: Criminals use dating apps to lure victims to meet in places such as hotels, restaurants, and bars, and then later assault and rob them. Numerous U.S. citizens in Colombia have been drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates. You should be cautious if using dating apps in Colombia. If meeting with a stranger, you should strongly consider meeting only in public places and avoiding isolated locations, such as residences or hotel rooms, where crimes are most likely to occur. Tell a friend or family member of your plans, including where you are going, details of the person you are meeting, and the app you used to meet them.\nATMs : There have been instances of fraudulent charges or withdrawals from accounts due to “skimmed” cards. If you choose to use credit or debit cards, you should regularly check your account to ensure there are no unauthorized transactions. Travelers should limit the amount of cash they carry in public, exercise caution when withdrawing cash from ATMs, and avoid ATMs located on the street. ATMs inside shopping malls or other protected locations are preferable. \nTaxis : U.S. government employees are prohibited from hailing taxis on the street due to the risk of assault or robbery. U.S. citizens have been killed during robberies while using taxis. Use a dispatch service or cell phone app whenever possible.\nDisabling Drugs : The Embassy receives regular reports of criminals using drugs to temporarily incapacitate unsuspecting victims and then rob or assault them. Scopolamine, a fast-acting incapacitating drug, is often surreptitiously applied to food, drinks, and hand sanitizer vials by criminals to rob or assault their victims. Victims of scopolamine-related crimes are often targeted in bars, night clubs, or through dating apps. Avoid leaving food or drinks unattended at a bar or restaurant, and refuse offers of something to eat or drink from a stranger.\nAyahuasca/Hallucinogens:  Traditional hallucinogens, often referred to as ayahuasca, can be marketed to tourists as “spiritual cleansing,” and typically contain dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a strong psychedelic that is illegal in the United States and many other countries. Risks to hallucinogen users while intoxicated include robbery, assault, illness, or death. People claiming to be shamans or spiritual practitioners are neither licensed nor regulated.\nDemonstrations :   Protests and demonstrations occur frequently, particularly in Bogota. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\nInternational Financial Scams :   See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Colombia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:  \nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 123 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +57 (601) 275-2000 or +57 (601) 275-4021 after hours. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. Help in domestic violence situations is available, in Spanish, by calling 155 (*155 from a cell phone).\nTourism : The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are uncommon. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified by the government or by recognized authorities. In the event of an injury, adequate medical treatment may only be available in or near major cities. First responders may only be able to provide basic medical treatment and may be unable to access areas outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .\nVenezuelan Border : The U.S. Department of State has categorized Venezuela as Level 4: Do Not Travel due to crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and the arrest and detention of U.S. citizens without due process or fair trial guarantees. U.S. citizens are at risk of detention when crossing into Venezuela from Colombia. The Colombia-Venezuela border is not clearly marked, and U.S. citizens should not go near the border due to the risk of crossing into Venezuela accidentally and being detained for illegal entry. If you still choose to travel to Venezuela, do not attempt to enter Venezuela without a visa. Visas are not available upon arrival. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods. The Maduro regime does not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens. The U.S. government has extremely limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela.\nCriminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or expelled.  \nIndividuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. \nCustoms Regulations : If you enter or exit Colombia possessing cash or other financial instruments worth more than $10,000USD, you must declare them and be able to prove the legal source of the funds. The Embassy has received reports of customs officials confiscating high-value jewelry that was not declared upon entry.\nColombian law prohibits tourists and business travelers from bringing firearms and ammunition into Colombia. Colombian law also restricts the importation of plants and animals (and some related products).\nArtifacts : Colombian law forbids the export of pre-Columbian objects and other artifacts protected by cultural patrimony statutes. U.S. customs officials are obliged to seize pre-Columbian objects and certain colonial religious artwork brought into the United States.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Colombia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long pre-trial detention and lengthy prison sentences under harsh conditions. Colombian law may require that released offenders serve a lengthy period of parole in-country, during which the offender is given no housing and may lack permission to work.\nColombia uses comprehensive screening procedures to detect narcotics smuggling at its international airports. Travelers are occasionally questioned, searched, fingerprinted, and/or asked to submit to an abdominal X-ray upon arrival or departure. Most airport inspectors do not speak English.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods : Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the   U.S. Department of Justice website   for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers : See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers : Colombia has one of the strongest legal frameworks in Latin America defending the rights of LGB people; however, in practice protections remain a long way from full enforcement and harassment persists, especially in rural areas. In many parts of Colombia, violence against trans people exceeds levels of violence against any other members of the LGB community. Criminals do utilize dating apps to target potential victims of theft, so travelers should use caution on such apps. Certain regions, especially in rural areas, experience higher instances of harassment/violence against LGB communities. In 2022, there was an uptick of homicides specifically targeting gay men in Medellín. LGB associated and friendly establishments exist mostly in metropolitan areas, especially Cartagena, Medellin, and Bogota. \nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities : The law in Colombia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities, but the law is not fully enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is not as prevalent as in the United States. Many public places and transportation are not adapted to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities. The most common types of accessible facilities may include restrooms, ramps, and elevators. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, including sidewalks, intersections, buses, and taxis. There is a significant difference between the capital (and other large cities) and the rest of the country. \nRepair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices are available. Sign language interpreters or personal assistants are available for hire. \nStudents : See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers : See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nCruise Ship Passengers : See our travel tips for  Cruise Ship Passengers .\nFor emergency services in Colombia, dial 123 from any mobile phone or land line.\nAmbulance services  are available in larger cities, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nWe do not pay medical bills .  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.

They also cannot use inter-city or intra-city bus transportation or travel by road outside urban areas at night. Follow these same precautions.\nRoad travel in Colombia can be dangerous, especially at night. Some roads are poorly maintained, or vulnerable to heavy rains and mudslides. Mountain roads may lack safety features such as crash barriers or guard rails, and conditions are frequently made more treacherous by heavy fog. Highways are often unmarked and unlit, and do not have signs indicating destinations. Slow-moving buses and trucks frequently stop in the middle of the road unexpectedly. In the countryside, livestock is often herded along roads or left to graze on roadsides. Due to a lack of sidewalks, roads are also used by pedestrians.\nThe use of motorcycles and bicycles is widespread throughout Colombia. U.S. government employees may not use motorcycles because of security concerns.\nTraffic Laws : Traffic laws are often ignored and rarely enforced, creating dangerous conditions for drivers and pedestrians. Seat belts are mandatory for all passengers in a private vehicle. Car seats are mandatory for children, and a child under ten years old is not permitted to ride in the front seat. It is against the law to talk on a cellular phone while driving.\nIf you are involved in an accident, you MUST remain at the scene without moving your vehicle until the authorities arrive. This rule is strictly enforced and moving a vehicle or leaving the scene of an accident may constitute an admission of guilt under Colombian law.\nPublic Transportation : Do not hail taxis on the street. U.S. government employees may not hail street taxis or use public transportation in Colombia because of security concerns. U.S. citizens have been killed during robberies while using taxis. Use a dispatch service or transportation app whenever possible.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of the Colombia national authority responsible for road safety, the  Instituto Nacional de Vias .\nAviation Safety Oversight : The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Colombia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Colombia’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel : Mariners planning travel to Colombia should also check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website  and the  NGA broadcast warnings .\nTourist Vessels : Exercise caution when embarked on small tourist boats off the northern coast between Cartagena and the nearby islands. During the months of December and January, the seas off the northern coast can be dangerous for small boats. U.S. citizens have died in boating accidents.

Do not leave valuables in an unattended vehicle. Even a locked car in an area with parking attendants can be a target. Police recommend travelers physically check car doors are locked because thieves have used jammers to block car key fobs. Avoid walking alone in isolated areas, especially after dark. Always be aware of your surroundings and keep your valuables out of sight.\nThe Embassy has received reports of robberies at isolated rental properties. Make sure your rental has adequate security and lock all doors and windows.\nSee  the Costa Rica Country Security Report  ( osac.gov ) for an overview of crime in Costa Rica.\nSee  the Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on international financial scams.\nVictims of Crime:   Report crimes to the local police at 911  and contact the United States Embassy at +506 2519-2000 or  acssanjose@state.gov . \nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. Authorities will only investigate and prosecute a crime if the victim files a police report (denuncia). The Costa Rican Investigative Police (OIJ) is responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that occur in Costa Rica.\nTo file a police report (denuncia) : Visit the local office of the OIJ (Investigative Police.) You can find the closest location through the OIJ app ‘OIJ CR Safe.’ In the following locations, Tourist Police can provide limited assistance to start the process:\n See our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\n  Victims of Sexual Assault:  Please dial 911 for local law enforcement assistance.

ICT also has safety and security information in  these English and Spanish language pamphlets.\nAdventure Sports:  Some tour operators may not follow international standards and best practices. Be careful when doing adventure activities such as hiking, rafting, zip lining, or sky diving. U. S. citizens have died in Costa Rica while doing adventure sports. Make sure your medical insurance covers your sport. Check our section on Medical Insurance under “Health” below. The Ministry of Health maintains a list of approved Adventure Sports operators. Do not do adventure sports alone. Always carry ID and let others know where you are. Before kayaking and rafting, check river conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Even popular rafting spots can become dangerous in flash floods. Carry a first aid kit and know where the nearest rescue center is. Follow all local or park rules and be careful in unknown places.\nHiking:  Follow signs in national parks and stay on marked trails. It can be hard for first responders to find missing people in remote areas.\nTo hike in national parks, you should:\nTourism:  The tourism industry is regulated, and rules are enforced. Inspections take place on a regular basis, but some tour operators are not registered. Hazardous areas or activities are not always identified with appropriate signs. Medical treatment is available, but traffic and road conditions can delay access to remote areas. U. S. citizens should consider  medical evacuation insurance .\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should first contact 911. Victims should also contact the Embassy for assistance.\nStudents and Volunteers:  See safety and security information provided by your host. Students and volunteers have been victims of serious crimes. You can file a complaint to  Costa Rica’s Tourism Commission.  Their phone is 800-TURISMO from Costa Rica or 011-506-2299-5800 from the United States. Their email is  contactenos@ict.go.cr .\nFor more information, see our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips.\nNatural Disasters:  Costa Rica is in an active earthquake and volcanic zone.\nFor information concerning disasters, see:\nFor more information about natural disasters, volcanic activity, and wildfires in Spanish, see:\nDemonstrations  are common in Costa Rica. Protests or strikes can affect transportation, fuel supplies, and other public services. Foreigners are not allowed to take part in public demonstrations. If you do, you might be detained or deported.\nCriminal Penalties:  You must follow local laws. If you break them, you could be deported, arrested, or put in jail. Some crimes can be prosecuted in the United States even if they happen abroad. Check our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. If you want to start a business in Costa Rica, talk to local authorities about the permits you need. The Embassy has received reports of impostors impersonating police officers and asking for bribes. If this happens, do not argue. Write down the officer's name and any numbers on their uniform or car. Report the incident by calling “911.”\nHallucinogens:  Ayahuasca, kambo, and other dangerous hallucinogens are sometimes offered to travelers as part of spiritual ceremonies or rituals. These substances are not regulated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and are illegal in the United States. Exercise extreme caution if you choose to participate in a spiritual ceremony or ritual. U. S. citizens have been victims of sexual assault, serious injury, and theft while under the influence of these substances. Be aware that you may put your safety at risk if you take part in a ceremony that uses ayahuasca or other hallucinogens.\nAlcohol/Drugs:  Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is illegal. You can get heavy fines and jail time for having, using, or selling illegal drugs. Marijuana and marijuana-related products are illegal in Costa Rica.\nProstitution/Sex Tourism:  Promoting or facilitating prostitution is illegal. Local laws on human trafficking and child exploitation have very harsh penalties, including fines and jail time.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask local authorities to notify the Embassy right away. See our  webpage  for more information. People accused of serious crimes can be held before trial. Because local prisons are crowded, courts may instead put you on home arrest. This means you cannot leave Costa Rica and must check in with judicial authorities. You have the right to a public defender and a translator for most hearings. \nJudicial Process:  Local court cases take longer than in the United States. Civil cases usually take more than five years to finish.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods may be illegal in Costa Rica. You could face fines and/or have to give up the goods when you arrive in the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Costa Rica has no legal restrictions on same-sex relations or LGB events. See   our  LGB Travel Information  page. See section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for more.\nTravelers Who Need Accessibility Assistance:  Costa Rica has limited accessibility and accommodation. Many buildings are not accessible. The Costa Rican Ombudsman’s Office has received complaints about accessibility. There also are reports of broken wheelchair lifts on public transportation.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nResidency:  U.S. citizens who want to live or stay long-term in Costa Rica should seek local legal guidance. A qualified attorney can advise you on the requirements for  legal residency . U. S. citizens who misuse their tourist status to live in Costa Rica can be deported and can also be restricted from entering the country.\nReal Estate:  Be very cautious with real estate purchases or investments. Consult with reputable legal counsel and review the contract completely. The Embassy cannot assist you with land or business disputes; you must be prepared to take your case to the local courts. Civil records of land titles can be incomplete or contradictory. Coastal land within 50 meters of the high tide line is public space. This land is closed to development. The next 150 meters inland (“Maritime Zone”) cannot be owned by foreign nationals. Land in this zone is governed by the local municipality. The Costa Rican government has taken private land from some U.S. investors without enough or timely compensation. Property owners should keep their property secure. Squatter groups have taken over properties. They use laws that let them claim unused land. Victims have reported threats, harassment, and violence.\nCheck the  Embassy’s website  for a list of local lawyers.\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nEmergency services in Costa Rica:\n  Health facilities in general:\nMedicine:\nThe United States Government does not pay medical bills of private citizens overseas.  United States Medicare/Medicaid does  not  apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do  not  accept U. S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas will require payment up front and will only accept cash. See our  webpage  for more on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  CDC  for more on travel insurance. \nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the CDC. \nPassengers coming from some  countries in South America or Africa must show proof of yellow fever vaccination .\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery:  U.S.   citizens have had serious issues, and some have died during or after cosmetic or elective surgery.\nMedical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. Understand that medical systems abroad are different than in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone traveling for medical purposes should consult with their physician before traveling.\nVisit the  CDC  website for information on Medical Tourism, its risks, and what you can do to prepare. \nYour legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in Costa Rica. \nCosta Rica has many elective and cosmetic surgery facilities that can match those in the United States, but the quality of care can vary. If you’re considering surgery in Costa Rica, make sure that emergency medical services are accessible. Make sure the professionals you choose are accredited and qualified. Always do your research to make informed decisions about your health.\nConfirm that:\nFor clinics offering alternative treatments, do your research. Unverified alternative treatments have led to hospitalization. Wellness centers are often not verified.\nAlcohol:  Drink alcohol in moderation. There have been reports of tainted alcohol causing serious health issues. If you feel sick after drinking, call 911 immediately. Costa Rica asks you to report the sale of unregulated or tainted alcohol to the Investigative Police (OIJ). Their phone number is 800-8000-645 and email is  denuncias.drpis@misalud.go.cr . You can also call the National Center for Intoxicants at 2223-1028 or 800-INTOXICA (4686-9422). If you are the victim of unregulated alcohol or another serious health violation, you should notify the U.S. Embassy in San Jose at +506-2519-2000. You can contact the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs at 1-888-407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and Canada) or 1-202-501-4444 (from all other countries). The Bureau is available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:  If you are considering traveling to Costa Rica to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our  ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . \nWater Quality:  Tap water is often not safe to drink. Bottled water is a better choice. Many places may serve tap water unless you ask for bottled. Be aware that ice for drinks may be using tap water.\nAdventure Travel:  Visit the CDC website for more information about  Adventure Travel . \nAir Quality:  The air quality varies and changes with the seasons. People at high risk from poor air quality include children, seniors, people with health conditions, and people exercising outside. Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. \nOther Health Information:  Diseases like dengue, zika, chikungunya, and malaria are present. The use of repellent is recommended.\nFollow standard procedures to protect yourself from HIV/AIDS.\nFor more information, you can visit the CDC and WHO websites about traveling in Costa Rica.\nThe Costa Rica Tourism Institute (ICT) has an English and Spanish language pamphlet with  tips for safe driving in Costa Rica .\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Be careful when driving. Roads can be in poor condition. Roads can have unclear lane markings, narrow shoulders, and large potholes. Signs may not be very clear, and visibility at intersections may be blocked by vegetation or other obstacles.\nBridges:  Bridges, even on heavily traveled roads, may be only a single lane. Rural roads sometimes lack bridges. Do not drive through water if you can't see its depth.\nTraffic Laws:  You must have a valid passport and a U.S. driver's license or an international driving permit.\nPublic Transportation:  Be aware of your surroundings when using public transport. Avoid showing expensive items, like jewelry, and keep your bags close. You are strongly advised to avoid public buses due to pickpocketing. Use only licensed taxis or well-known ride-sharing services. Never accept rides from unlicensed vehicles.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of Costa Rica’s  national tourist office  and national authority responsible for road safety.\nUnpaid traffic tickets:  U.S.   citizens have reported to the Embassy that car rental companies charge credit cards for unpaid tickets. The Embassy cannot help in such cases."

If a U.S. citizen arrives without the proper visa, immigration may take your passport. They will return it when you go to the immigration office the next business day and pay the visa fees. You can find more information online at  Côte d’Ivoire e-visas.\nAn export permit issued by the National Museum is required for all high-value pieces of art being removed from Côte d'Ivoire. The export permit costs 2,000 CFA plus 500 CFA per object.\nU.S. citizens who plan to live in Côte d’Ivoire must apply for a residency permit (titre de séjour) at the Office d’Identification Nationale. (Note: Titres de séjour are not issued to children under the age of 16 who are documented on their parents' visas.)\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Côte d’Ivoire.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs information  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are using simpler methods to attack. These include knives, firearms, and vehicles. They use them to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nCôte d’Ivoire still faces threats from violent extremist groups in the region. These groups are active across the borders of Burkina Faso and Mali. Côte d’Ivoire is not a base for these groups. Violent extremist groups in the region have stated they will target foreigners and/or countries that participate in counterterrorism efforts. For more information, see our  Terrorism  page. \nCrime is common. Property crime includes burglaries and car theft. Violent crime includes carjacking, armed robberies of homes and streets. Illegal firearms are readily available throughout the country. Banditry and other violent crimes continue. They happen day and night in the countryside. During holidays (including major Muslim and Christian holidays), robberies and opportunistic crimes increase. These crimes include burglaries of cars and homes. Criminals seldom harm victims of street crime if they comply with demands. Assailants have used violence if victims refuse to hand over valuables.\nLaw enforcement is somewhat effective at deterring crime but lacks adequate resources. Security services often lack radios, guns, and cars. This severely limits their ability to respond. Many gendarmes and police stations outside of Abidjan have one vehicle for the whole precinct. They often get distress calls from the public via cell phone because they lack a centralized dispatch system. Responses to incidents of crime are often slow and generally limited to writing a report. The legal system lacks resources and tools to handle its current cases, and cannot jail criminals according to global standards.\nU.S. citizens should be careful when visiting the Abobo, Adjame, Angre, Koumassi, Marcory, and Yopougon districts in Abidjan. They should also be careful in popular night areas, including Plateau, Treichville, and Zone 4.\nAlways carry identification to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints.\nUniformed police, military, and gendarmes routinely stop vehicles. They do so for traffic violations and security checks. If you find yourself at such a stop, politely present your identification. Police and security officials rarely speak English. Incidents of police or security force harassment or detention of foreigners are rare but do occur. If an officer asks you to pay a bribe, politely refuse and present a photocopy of your U.S. passport, visa, and entry stamp.\nThere are weapons are left over from the civil war. They are a security threat. Criminals, rogue soldiers, and groups with common political views can exploit them. They pose an ongoing risk to Côte d’Ivoire’s fragile democracy. \nFor more information, please see  Côte d’Ivoire’s Travel Advisory .\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nElection-related violence is another concern. The next presidential election is planned for 2025. Riots and demonstrations have occurred around elections. They have sometimes resulted in deaths. They may continue due to ongoing political tensions.\nFor more information, please see  Côte d’Ivoire’s Travel Advisory .\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nInternet romance and financial scams are increasingly prevalent in Côte d’Ivoire. Scams often start with Internet postings or profiles. They can also start with unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at +225-27-22-47-06-96, +225-01-03-79-91-44 (the Operations Center for the National Police), or 100/111 (the Ministry of Security in Plateau, Abidjan). Contact the U.S. Embassy at (+225) 27-22-49-40-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  Little formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment may not be available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nPiracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom pose big threats to U.S. ships in the Gulf of Guinea. They also threaten U.S. mariners on a ship or traveling to or from one in the Gulf of Guinea. Pirates target a variety of vessels, and it is not uncommon for them to fire upon vessels during boardings and attempted boardings. Please find the latest U.S. Maritime Advisory  here .\nWeather Safety:  The rainy season is from June to September. It often includes heavy rains and flash flooding. This is especially true in low-lying areas. Heavy rains have caused landslides, riverbank erosion, bridge washouts, and property damage. Roads may be closed suddenly and stay closed for indefinite periods of time, especially in more remote areas. U.S. citizens should watch local weather and news reports. They should avoid driving through flooded areas. And, they should keep water and emergency supplies at home.\nCriminal Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to laws of the foreign countries they visit. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. People starting a business or practicing a licensed profession should seek information from local authorities. They should do this before starting to practice or operate a business.\nFurthermore, you can be prosecuted in the United States for some acts committed overseas, even if those acts are not illegal where they happened, for example, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCustoms:  Ivoirian customs authorities encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet. It is for temporary admission of professional equipment, samples, and goods for exhibitions and fairs. ATA Carnet Headquarters, at the  U.S. Council for International Business,  1212 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, issues and guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States. For additional information, call (212) 354-4480 or email  ATA Carnet Headquarters . Business travelers can bring laptop computers into the country without difficulty. Traveling with desktop computers or other electronics in large numbers may cause a problem. It may look like you're bringing them into the country to resell. Travelers should show a business reason for such equipment. They can use an ATA or submit a letter to the Director General of Customs to ask for temporary admission.\nIf traveling to another West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) country, expatriate residents leaving Côte d’Ivoire must declare the amount of currency being taken out of the country. Residents visiting CFA Franc countries, but not WAEMU members, cannot take CFA Francs out of Côte d’Ivoire. They can carry up to 2,000,000 CFA Francs (about 4,000 USD) in other currencies. You can take funds more than that amount out of the country in the form of travelers or bank checks.\nIf you travel to any non-WAEMU country, tourists can't take more than 500,000 CFA Francs (about 1,000 USD). Business operators can't take more than 2,000,000 CFA Francs (about 4,000 USD) without government approval.\nFor more on customs rules, travelers can check the Ivoirian Customs Agency’s  website .\nCorruption is a serious problem in Côte d’Ivoire. It affects judicial proceedings, contract awards, customs, and taxes. Police, military, and gendarmes routinely stop cars for traffic violations and security checks. If you are stopped, politely present your identification. Police and security officials rarely speak English. If you are stopped at one of these checkpoints and asked to pay a bribe, refuse politely. Then, present your photocopy of your U.S. passport, visa, and entry stamp.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Côte d’Ivoire. However, same-sex marriage is not recognized under local law. The laws only mention same-sex sexual activity as a form of public indecency. It carries a penalty of up to two years in prison, the same as for illegal heterosexual acts. Antidiscrimination laws exist. But, they do not cover discrimination based on sexual orientation.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Côte d’Ivoire bans discrimination against people with physical and mental disabilities. But, it is not well enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. According to the 2019 Human Rights Report, people with disabilities reportedly faced discrimination. This discrimination happened in employment and education. Prisons and detention centers provided no accommodations for persons with disabilities. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in Abidjan and throughout the country.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers . \nAbidjan has privately-run medical and dental facilities that are adequate, but do not fully meet U.S. standards. Good physician specialists can be found, although few speak English. While pharmacies are well-stocked with medications produced in Europe, newer drugs may not be available. If you plan a lengthy trip to Côte d’Ivoire, you should bring enough medication to last the entire stay in your carry-on luggage. Medical care outside of Abidjan is extremely limited.\nFor emergency services in Côte d’Ivoire, dial the numbers below.\nFor emergency medical transport in Côte d’Ivoire, public ambulances are free. Private ones charge a fee. Ambulances may be contacted at the numbers below:\nAmbulance services in the public system are rare. Training and the availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulance services are also not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to hire a private ambulance or take a taxi or private vehicle. They do this to reach the nearest major hospital rather than wait for a public ambulance.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for more information. They have details on the insurance to get before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental medical insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in the original packaging. Also, carry your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Ministry of Health & Public Hygiene  to ensure the medication is legal in Côte d’Ivoire. \nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther Health Information:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth Facilities in General:\nPharmaceuticals:\nWater Quality:\nAdventure Travel:\nGeneral Health:\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend mosquito repellents. They also recommend sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.\nHIV/AIDS:  Data from UNAIDS Spectrum Estimates in February 2023 shows that Côte d’Ivoire has an HIV prevalence rate of 1.8 percent for 15- to 64-year-olds. The rates are higher for female sex workers, and men who have sex with men: 23.6 percent, 18.54 percent, and 13.33 percent. Annually, there are approximately 7,700 new HIV infections (300 among children) and 10,300 AIDS-related deaths in Côte d’Ivoire.  \nAir Quality: \nVisit  AirNow  for information on air quality at U.S. embassies and consulates.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road safety is a big concern in Côte d’Ivoire. U.S. Embassy officers are banned from driving outside of major cities after dark. This includes driving between Abidjan, Grand Bassam, and Assinie. Visibility is often poor, even in developed areas with streetlights. Crashes happen often on roads between major cities. They involve big commercial or private vehicles. It is common to see overturned or broken-down vehicles that may block routes and create traffic congestion. Cargo transport vehicles are often overloaded and do not follow standard safety practices.\nThe Embassy can provide consular services outside of the Abidjan area. But, its ability to do so is limited. This includes emergency aid. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling to the Northern and Northeastern border region. Many areas of Côte d’Ivoire are difficult to access, and travel in these areas is hazardous. Outside of the major cities, infrastructure is poor, medical care is limited, and there are few facilities for tourists.\nCarjacking incidents have been reported in Abidjan, including vehicles with diplomatic plates. While stopped in traffic, allow enough room between your car and the one in front to maneuver out if needed. Before getting into your car, look around to see if anyone is paying unusual attention. If someone appears to be watching, do not go to your vehicle. If confronted, remain courteous and calm and, if threatened with violence, in most cases do not resist. Street criminals often employ threats of violent tactics when accosting their victims. When victims hand over their valuables, the encounter normally ends without further incident or harm. But, street criminals have been known to act on violent threats. They do so when victims resist handing over their things. Please report any incident to the U.S. Embassy.\nTraffic Laws:  Authorities rarely enforce traffic laws. The patrol presence of Ivoirian security forces on roadways outside of the capital at night is limited or non-existent. Still, police checkpoints are common on major roads throughout the country. They often increase after security incidents. There are many police roadblocks on the major routes outside of Abidjan. They may be permanent or informal. At these roadblocks, officers allegedly pressure travelers for bribes.\nDrivers should know that using a cell phone while driving and not wearing a seatbelt are against the law. They usually result in an immediate fine. Persons cited for a traffic violation should request a receipt for any items confiscated or fines paid. It is legal to pay fines to police officers on the side of the road for small speeding violations not to exceed 2000 CFA (approximately US $4). The amount should be clearly printed on the ticket. Some traffic violations (driving without insurance) may result in driver detention. \nIf you are in an accident, call police. If you believe the situation might become hostile, call or travel to the nearest police or gendarme’s station. Impatient drivers frequently disregard traffic laws and drive recklessly. Cars and trucks frequently travel without functioning headlights.\nPublic Transportation:  Abidjan has a poor public transportation system. If you choose to travel by bus, the “Express” line is believed to be the safest and most reliable service. Taxis are readily available and inexpensive; you may be able to negotiate a better rate than drivers’ initial fare offers. They are, however, poorly maintained and notorious for not respecting the rules of the road. There have been reports of robberies in metered or orange taxis. But, people still widely think they are the safest public transport.\nCommunal taxis (“woro-woros”), used only within the limits of each commune, are not metered and may be dangerous. Do not use communal taxis or local vans (“Gbaka”) because they are frequently involved in accidents. Always travel in groups and avoid driving on roads outside of Abidjan at night.\nRide-share applications are available in parts of Côte d’Ivoire, including Uber, Yango, and Heetch. Ride-share services allow a rider to input the origin and destination addresses, and the driver can use the in-app GPS. They have different service levels (e.g. economy, comfort, UberXL). The higher tiers have modern vehicles and air conditioning. These services are good for travelers with limited French. They are often safer than hailing street taxis, because the app verifies the driver.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the websites of  Côte d’Ivoire’s Ministry of Tourism  and  Ministry of Transportation .\nOversight of Aviation Safety:  Direct commercial air services go to the United States. They are operated by carriers registered outside of Côte d’Ivoire. But, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not yet assessed Côte d’Ivoire’s Civil Aviation Authority. The assessment would be for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page.\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Côte d’Ivoire should check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts.  Piracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom threaten U.S. flagged vessels in the Gulf of Guinea. They also threaten U.S. mariners on a vessel or traveling to or from a vessel in the Gulf of Guinea. Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website  and the  NGA broadcast warnings."

Emergency lights or signals are rare, making it virtually impossible to detect hazards after dark.  Street signage is insufficient and confusing. Many Cuban cars are old, in poor condition, and lack reliable safety equipment.  Heed caution throughout the country as there are rolling blackouts which may leave streets dark and without traffic lights, even in major cities.\nThe principal Cuban east-west highway is in good condition but extends only part of the way from Havana to the eastern end of the island.  Hazards – including unfenced livestock and farm vehicles – are common. \nWhen traveling by road, you should carry a printed map of the area, as electronic (smartphone) maps frequently fail due to connectivity issues.\nTraffic Laws:   Speed limits are sometimes posted and passengers in automobiles are required to wear seatbelts, if available.  All motorcyclists are required to wear helmets.  Traffic from major roads generally does not stop when entering roundabouts.  Use care at intersections: stop signs are often hard to see. \nPublic Transportation:  Buses designated for tourist travel, both between and within cities, generally meet international standards.  \nThe public bus and rail system in Cuba is under-resourced and in poor condition.  Public buses used by Cubans, known as \"guaguas,\" are crowded, unreliable, and are sometimes preyed upon by petty criminals. There is a heightened threat of pickpocketing on crowded buses and trains. Embassy personnel are advised not to use public transportation.\nAvoid using informal taxis or hailing private vehicles for rides as they are unregulated, the vehicles are often in disrepair, and usually do not have normal vehicle safety equipment such as seat belts and air bags.  “Cocos,” smaller, yellow ball-shaped “tuk-tuk” style vehicles, are not safe, and the Embassy advises its personnel not to use them.\nRental car agencies provide roadside assistance to their clients as a condition of rental contracts.  Travelers should not permit unauthorized persons to drive their rental vehicles.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Cuba, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Cuba’s Civil Aviation Authority under its International Aviation Safety Assessment program (IASA) for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Some beaches charge a fee for access and employ private security, which provides some deterrent to crime. \nKeep a copy of your valid U.S. passport in a secure location in case your passport is stolen.\nViolent crime, including rape and armed robbery – although not common – does occur. Exercise caution when visiting more isolated areas of the island. Some thefts and assaults have been reported near nature areas, remote beaches, and small or informal parking areas used by divers.  \nIf you are traveling with children, be aware that the legal drinking age of 18 is not always enforced, so extra parental supervision may be appropriate.  Take standard precautions when frequenting nightclubs and bars.

However, there are exceptions to this rule. For detailed information, contact the  The Netherlands Embassy  in Washington, DC, or one of the  Dutch Consulates  in the United States.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.

Proceed through intersections with caution as traffic signs are often hidden or nonexistent.  Roads are extremely slippery when it rains.  Look out for scooters, motorcycles, and ATVs, as drivers of these vehicles may not strictly follow traffic rules. Be alert for speeding cars and drunk drivers. In rural areas, watch out for goats and other animals that cross the road unexpectedly. Night driving is reasonably safe, as long as drivers are familiar with the route and road conditions. Roads are not as well-lit as in the United States. Driving while intoxicated may result in the loss of a driver’s license, fine, and imprisonment. \nTraffic Laws:  Vehicles operate on the right-hand side in Curaçao. You can drive in Curaçao with a valid U.S. driver’s license. Right turns at red lights are prohibited. Traffic signs prohibiting actions have a red circle around them, but not the red slash you expect to see in the United States. Local laws require drivers and passengers to wear seat belts, and motorcyclists to wear helmets. Children must ride in the back seat, and children under 5 years of age must be in a child safety seat. \nAt intersections and traffic circles, yield to traffic coming from your right unless signs indicate otherwise. Right turns at red lights are prohibited. U-turns are often restricted. Traffic signs prohibiting actions have a red circle around them, but not the red slash you expect to see in the United States.

Large buses (called ‘Konvooi’) travel limited, longer-distance routes, typically once per hour. Mini-vans and mini-buses bearing the word “BUS” on their registration plates travel shorter routes on main roads. They are inexpensive and run non-stop during the daytime with no fixed schedule. Each minibus has a specific route that is displayed on the front windshield. Taxis are expensive, but generally safe and well-regulated. There are no meters, so passengers should determine the price in advance.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of  Curaçao’s Tourism Board  for more information about transportation.\nWatersports Advisory:  You should carefully assess the potential risks inherent in recreational water activities and measure your participation in them against your physical capabilities and skills. Never venture out alone, particularly at isolated beaches or far out to sea. Avoid entering the water above your waist if you have been drinking and always be mindful of watercraft traffic in the area. When in doubt, stay out!  \nCliff Jumping and Diving Advisory:  Carefully consider the potential risks inherent in cliff jumping and cliff diving. Individuals have suffered serious injuries from engaging in these activities in Curaçao.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Curaçao, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Curaçao’s civil aviation authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Curaçao must have completed a Customs Form 1300, Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement declaring their intention to travel to Curaçao prior to their departure from the U.S. port.

Armed groups, individuals, and military forces routinely clash with each other. Civilians are frequently targeted in attacks and other illegal activities, such as kidnapping, forced taxation, and forced labor. \nTerrorist and armed groups operating in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have regularly attacked military and civilian targets and represent an ongoing threat to humanitarian aid workers and other NGO personnel operating in the area.

Criminal elements do not typically single out U.S. citizens, but may view them as targets of opportunity based on perceived affluence or vulnerability.\nRoadblocks:  Security forces set up spontaneous roadblocks, especially after dark, to conduct vehicle searches and check identity papers. They may also solicit bribes. Remain inside your vehicle with doors locked and open the window slightly to communicate. Remain calm and, if threatened, do not resist.\nDemonstrations:  Demonstrations and gatherings occur with increasing frequency and with little notice. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on significant holidays, and during international events. Police have at times responded to demonstrations with heavy-handed tactics that resulted in civilian casualties and arrests.

Border skirmishes have occurred in the past.\nMany border areas between Djibouti and both Ethiopia and Somalia lack visible demarcation and may still contain landmines.\nCrime:  Crimes of opportunity are most common and include pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from or of vehicles, and  identity theft  (by stealing credit card information).\nDemonstrations:  Demonstrations occur occasionally and sometimes without warning. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI   pages for information.  \n\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of serious crimes, including victims of sexual assault, are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 17 throughout Djibouti (French/Arabic) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +253 21-453-000 during business house and +(253) 77-877-229 after hours.

Hazardous areas or activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available in the capital, Djibouti City. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long prison sentences and heavy fines.  Although the narcotic  khat  is legal in Djibouti, it is illegal in many countries, including the United States.  Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. \nPhotography:  It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations or personnel, and other infrastructure such as air and seaports, bridges, and public buildings, as well as of religious sites, such as mosques. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and/or expulsion. Do not take photos of Djiboutians without their permission.\nChildren:  Dual Somali-U.S. or Djiboutian-U.S. citizens should be aware that moving children to Djibouti or Somalia (including Somaliland) from the United States for the purpose of having Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) performed can be prosecuted in both countries. FGM/C is illegal under both Djiboutian and U.S. law.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information. Djiboutian law enforcement officials occasionally prevent foreigners from contacting anyone while in detention. Because of this, the U.S. Embassy may not receive notification of an arrest or may not be allowed access to you if you are detained.\nPhone Service:  Although land lines do exist in parts of Djibouti, cellular phones are the norm. You may purchase a SIM card locally for use in an unlocked GSM cell phone. You will need to present your passport to complete the purchase. The national cellular phone provider is Djibouti Telecom. Telecommunications systems outside of Djibouti City are unreliable or non-existent.\nCurrency:  The Djiboutian Franc (DJF) is the official currency. It is a cash economy; credit cards are accepted at major hotels and supermarkets only. Most vendors and banks will only take bills printed after 2006 due to counterfeiting. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. ATMs are limited and may not recognize U.S.-issued credit cards, including MasterCard, though Visa generally works.\nFirearms:  Strict regulations may be enforced on the temporary import and export of firearms.  Contact the Embassy of Djibouti  in Washington, D.C., or the Djibouti National Police for specific information regarding customs and registration requirements prior to travel. Hunting without a permit is illegal.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to relinquish them if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information. \nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  While there are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events, societal norms do not allow for the public discussion of homosexuality and there are no known LGB organizations. Authorities may prosecute public display of same-sex sexual conduct under laws prohibiting attacks on “good morals.” No antidiscrimination law exists to protect LGB individuals. See our  LGB Travel Information  page and section six of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Djibouti does not prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Few government buildings, schools, banks, or grocery stores have accessible facilities, including in Djibouti City. Some hospitals and clinics are equally inaccessible to people with disabilities and lack wheelchair ramps or lifts, including some of the hospitals travelers commonly use. Expect accessibility to be very limited in transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\nAccessibility equipment is generally not available in Djibouti. Replacement parts, rental and repair facilities for aids/equipment/devices or service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants are not available.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  The law prohibits female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and the government is actively working to eliminate the practice. While rates of new FGM/C cases have declined, 70.7% of women and girls nationally have been subjected to the practice. Reliable rape statistics are not available, and laws for sentencing perpetrators are not enforced effectively. Domestic violence is common but underreported. Rather than the courts, families and the informal clan-based justice system generally handle cases of domestic abuse or violence. Police rarely intervene in domestic violence incidents. The National Union of Djiboutian Women operates a walk-in counseling center (Cellule d’Ecoute) in Djibouti City that provides services and referrals for women and men. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nPlease visit the  Embassy's COVID-19 page  for more information on COVID-19 in Djibouti.  \n \nConsult the  CDC website for Djibouti  prior to travel.\nMedical facilities in the capital of Djibouti are limited, and facilities are nonexistent in many outlying areas. Trauma care is only intended to stabilize a patient prior to medical evacuation. Medicines are expensive and often in short supply. Most care providers expect payment in U.S. dollars or Djiboutian francs before treatment is provided.\nFor emergency services in Djibouti, dial 18. \nAmbulance services are available from Balbala Hospital in Djibouti City. To obtain ambulance services contact Moussa, cell phone #77824912.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. \nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. \nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Ministry of Health  to ensure the medication is legal in Djibouti. \nDual U.S.-Djiboutian citizens with disabilities may qualify for education and health services through the Ministry of National Solidarity and the Ministry for the Promotion of Women and Family Planning.\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nUse the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.\nGiven Djibouti’s proximity to the Arabian Peninsula, the  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  (MERS) is also a risk.\nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n Further health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Although main roads in Djibouti City are well maintained, others are unpaved or in poor repair and subject to unexpected flooding. Highways are prone to frequent rockslides. Many roads wind through steep ravines and lack guardrails.\nPolice occasionally set up random roadblock stops on major roads to conduct inspections of vehicle registration and insurance.\nOutside of Djibouti City, hazards include narrow roads, insufficient lighting, poor vehicle maintenance (missing headlights) and wayward pedestrians and livestock. Police set up roadblocks on major roads which are not clearly visible at night. Other risks include excessive speeding and erratic driving habits. The widespread use of the narcotic khat by drivers contributes to speeding and unsafe driving habits.\nWhen driving outside Djibouti City, use convoys of two vehicles in case one car becomes disabled and avoid all travel after dark. Carry additional fuel and provisions (water, satellite phone, first aid kit). Gas stations are located at a considerable distance from one another and sell only diesel fuel in rural areas. There are few professional roadside assistance services.\nLandmines:  Stay on paved roads. Unmarked landmines exist in the border region with Eritrea, though most landmines have been marked or cleared from border regions.\nTraffic Laws:  A U.S. driver’s license or International Driving Permit is required to drive in Djibouti. The use of cell phones while driving is prohibited. Exercise caution at intersections; drivers often run red lights and do not stop at intersections. Third-party liability insurance is required, and you must display the insurance sticker.\nAccidents:  Remain inside the vehicle and wait for the traffic police or gendarmes. If a hostile mob forms or you feel you are in danger, leave the scene in your vehicle if possible and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. If you are injured, drive to the nearest hospital or clinic.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid all travel by public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. Hotel and airport shuttle services are a safe alternative. Taxis are available but are considered unsafe. U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from riding in buses or taxis.\nThe capital city and the towns of Obock and Tadjoura have intercity bus and ferry services. An electric limited rail, replacing the century-old Ethio-Djibouti railway, began operation in October 2016 with freight service and, later, passenger service.\nHiring a vehicle:  Reputable car rental firms can include the services of a driver. Be particularly vigilant at airports where criminals use luggage tag information to present themselves as pre-arranged drivers. Do not use your passport as a security deposit. If you allow your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Djibouti, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Djibouti’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. See the  FAA’s safety assessment page . Due to security concerns, U.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from taking commercial flights originating in Somalia that stop in Djibouti as part of a multi-leg flight.\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Djibouti should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings . \nThe threat of piracy remains significant. Pirates have held foreigners hostage for ransom. Reports of attacks on local fishing boats in Djiboutian coastal waters continue. Djiboutian military ships are clearly marked and may turn away small craft or divert vessels to verify citizenship of passengers.\nUse established sea lanes, and pilot vessels in groups to reduce the risk of being hijacked.\nSee the  Live Piracy Report  published by the International Maritime Bureau.\nIn case of emergency, contact the Djiboutian Coast Guard or Djiboutian Navy on UHF marine channel 16, or the Yemeni Coast Guard on channel 16 or at 967 1-562-402.\nPort Security:  The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Djibouti ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Djibouti. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Djibouti should exercise increased caution."

U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.

Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Accessible facilities, information, communication/access to services and ease of movement is limited in most parts of the country. Large resorts and Santo Domingo may have some generally accessible infrastructure, but travelers should not expect the level available in the United States.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nDisaster Preparedness:  Register with the Embassy on or before your arrival through our  travel registration website . In the event of a natural disaster or emergency, this will keep you informed. Additional information on  natural disasters and disaster preparedness  can be found on our website. \n \n Real Estate:  Property rights are irregularly enforced, and investors often encounter problems in receiving clear title to land. Consult a reputable attorney before signing documents or closing on any real estate transactions. Real estate investments by U.S. citizens have been subject to legal and physical takeover attempts. Absentee landlords and absentee owners of undeveloped land are particularly vulnerable. Consider purchasing title insurance. \n \n Scams:  Scammers often target elderly people by pretending to be a law enforcement official, an attorney, or a U.S. Embassy official, claiming that a loved one has been arrested overseas.

In 2019 six people died per day due to traffic accidents in the Dominican Republic.\nFrequent hazards include:\nTraffic Laws:  Traffic laws are not enforced consistently. After an accident causing serious injury or death, authorities will often take the driver into custody, even if the driver is insured and appears to have not been at fault. Detentions frequently last until a judicial decision has been reached or until a waiver has been signed by the injured party.\nSeat belts, and helmets for motorcyclists, are required by law. Violators may be fined. There are no child car seat laws. Police stop drivers using cell phones without a hands-free device.\nPublic Transportation:  Public transportation includes a metro and public bus system as well as shared bus or van taxis known as “guaguas” (converted vans or microbuses, often without doors). Guaguas run regular routes within urban areas and between towns in the countryside. Public buses and guaguas operating in the capital do not meet U.S. safety standards. \n \nAvoid unregulated taxis, which also often lack basic safety features. Use a reputable taxi service, either one recommended by your hotel or a well-known, vetted company. Rideshare services such as Uber are available in many parts of the country. Private bus lines travel between large cities and to popular tourist destinations. \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.

Under that agreement, U.S. citizens who legally enter any of those four countries may travel freely among the other three countries for up to 90 days total.\nIf you wish to remain in the CA-4 region for more than 90 days, you must request a one-time extension from local immigration authorities in the country where you are present. If you are “expelled” from one of the four countries, you are expelled from the entire CA-4 region.\nMinors:  A U.S. citizen minor present in El Salvador for  more  than one year is considered a  resident  of El Salvador. To leave El Salvador, a minor resident needs written consent from any parent listed on the child’s birth certificate that is not traveling with the minor. The consent form must be notarized by a Salvadoran notary. The Salvadoran government will not accept a consent form notarized at the U.S. Embassy.  The process to obtain the consent can be lengthy. Plan ahead if you intend to have your minor child travel without both parents after being present in El Salvador for more than one year .\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any specific HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or for foreign residents of El Salvador. Antiretroviral medication with a prescription can be imported for personal use and for the duration of stay. \nFind information on   dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction ,  customs regulations  on our websites.\nVolunteers, Mission Groups, and Non-Profits:  Groups bringing donated supplies, equipment, or medicine may experience difficulties with customs. Groups should clear all donated material with the appropriate Salvadoran government office before arriving in El Salvador. Contact the Dirección Nacional de Medicamentos (National Directorate of Medications) via email at  donaciones@medicamentos.gob.sv  to bring in donated medicines.\nThe crime threat level in El Salvador is high and our  Travel Advisory  warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution due to crime. See below for additional information on crime.\nDial 911 for emergency assistance in El Salvador.  Demonstrations  occur anywhere, and are most common near the capital of San Salvador. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events.\nCrime:  Crimes in El Salvador include robbery, car theft, sexual assault, and other crimes.\nIn the past, gangs, primarily Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street (M18) or sub factions of each, controlled a majority of the space in El Salvador and were the source of many crimes including extortion. Since 2022, the Government of El Salvador has severely disrupted gang-related activities. This has led to a significant reduction in crime throughout the country. While levels have dropped, crime, including violent crime, still occurs.\nU.S. Embassy government employees and their family members are permitted to travel throughout the country but may not travel between cities after dark, except for the route between San Salvador and the Comalapa International Airport, as well as the highway between San Salvador and tourist destinations along the littoral highway in La Libertad. This is largely due to infrastructure concerns and criminal activity. Additionally, U.S. government employees may not use public buses.\nExercise caution at all times and practice good personal security procedures throughout your stay.\nThe  tourist police force (POLITUR)   provides security and assistance to tourists in 19 tourist destinations. Avoid hikes and guides in locations without an official guide service or police presence, regardless of advice found on the Internet. \nMost serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved. The Government of El Salvador lacks sufficient resources to properly investigate and prosecute cases and to deter violent crime. \nDo not purchase counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Counterfeit goods can be seized on entry to the United States. You might also face legal issues in El Salvador. \nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (503) 2501-2999 Emergency After-Hours Telephone: +(503) 2501-2999. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, you may call 911.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage\nWatersports:   Surfing is extremely popular in El Salvador and one of the reasons for the growth in tourism. El Salvador's Pacific Coast beaches are very risky for swimming. Strong undertows and currents can be dangerous, even for skilled swimmers. Most public beaches have government lifeguards, but private beaches may not. Follow all instructions of any lifeguard, and do not enter the water anywhere you see red warning flags. In addition, El Salvador’s search and rescue capabilities are limited, and access to medical resources in beach areas is inadequate. Check the risks of recreational water activities. Also, think about your own abilities and skills. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination.           \nState of Exception:  In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador declared a “State of Exception” in response to an increase in homicides; the State of Exception continues today. The State of Exception suspended several constitutional rights, including the normal protections of criminal procedure such as the right to a speedy trial. Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception, some in a reportedly arbitrary manner. The number of all detainees has increased significantly.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be ejected from the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in El Salvador are severe.  (Please note that any items containing THC, even certain CBD products that are legal and widely available in the United States, are illegal in El Salvador) . Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. In December 2024, El Salvador instituted a zero-tolerance law for driving under the influence, and any level of alcohol will result in detention.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the  U.S. Embassy  immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nGuns:  You must have a locally obtained license to possess or carry a firearm in El Salvador. Convictions for possessing an unlicensed firearm can carry a prison sentence of three to five years. The U.S. Embassy cannot intervene on your behalf.\nDisaster Preparedness:  Preparing for natural disasters is crucial in El Salvador. The country has 21 active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. During the rainy season, severe flooding and mudslides often occur.\nFind information about natural disaster preparedness on the  U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)  website. Find information in Spanish about earthquakes (sismos) and other natural disasters in El Salvador on the  Government of El Salvador’s web page . Learn more on our  webpage about crisis and disaster preparedness .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nInternational Volunteers:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in El Salvador. There is, however, no recognition of same-sex marriage and widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, access to health care, and identity documents. Public officials, including the police, have reportedly engaged in violence and discrimination against LGB persons. See our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in El Salvador prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and access to services. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, and common in newly built infrastructure. The area around the capital is more accessible than other places in the country.\nSee our  Travelers with Disabilities  page.\nFor emergency services in El Salvador, dial 132. \nThe full range of medical care is available in San Salvador, but medical care outside of the city is limited. Care in some private hospitals is generally adequate for most common illnesses and injuries.\nAmbulance services are: \nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies and consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid do not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  Insurance Overseas  page for more information on insurance providers with coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on what type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Government of El Salvador  to ensure the medication is legal in El Salvador.\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nYou can find detailed information on vaccinations and other health precautions on the following websites:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nMajor highways in El Salvador are among the best in Central America, but road conditions are not up to U.S. standards. Even within the city of San Salvador, it is common to see missing manhole covers and large objects in the roadway marking the danger.\nDo not drive at night or when it's hard to see. Slow-moving vehicles are often on the road, and some may not have taillights. Mini-buses, regular buses, and taxis are poorly maintained. Drivers are frequently unlicensed and generally do not adhere to traffic rules and regulations. You can expect to find pedestrians walking on the roadways and, in rural areas, it is common to encounter livestock on the road.\nTraffic Laws:  Traffic laws are not enforced; drive defensively. Passing on blind corners or cutting across several lanes of traffic is commonplace. Two lane traffic circles are common and are especially dangerous to navigate.\nIf you are in an accident, call the police. The law says everyone in a vehicle accident must stay at the scene. You should move the car if safe and wait for police to arrive. You can leave if you think staying is unsafe. Leaving the scene could lead to future legal complications, but always maintain your personal safety. When police come, be ready to give your name, address, vehicle registration, insurance, and driver's license info. Be aware there are legal consequences to admitting fault.\nHit and run accidents are common. The law mandates that a driver must be detained and arrested if they cause injury or death in an accident while under the influence of alcohol or lacking a proper driver's license.\nYou may drive with a U.S. driver’s license for up to 30 days. After that time, you must obtain a Salvadoran license.\nIf you want to apply for a Salvadoran driver’s license, you must present an authenticated copy of your U.S. driver’s license to Salvadoran authorities. Requests for an apostille or authentication certificate are generally submitted in writing to your state’s Notary commissioning authority (usually the Secretary of State’s office.)\nIn December 2024, Salvadoran transportation authorities began enforcing a new “Zero Tolerance” law for drinking and driving. Driving with ANY blood alcohol level is now a criminal offense, with prison sentences of 2-5 years for private vehicles. Police are known to conduct sobriety checks and can test drivers for alcohol even if they are pulled over for a minor traffic violation.\nPublic Transportation:  Please refer to our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of El Salvador’s  national tourist office  and the  national authority responsible for road safety . Further information on traffic and road conditions is available in Spanish from  Automovil Club de El Salvador (ACES) .\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of El Salvador’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of El Salvador’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to El Salvador should also check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings  website."

However, the Government of Equatorial Guinea may require medical documentation including the determination of the HIV status of third country nationals who are renewing or obtaining residency in Equatorial Guinea. Please verify this information with the  Embassy of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea  before you travel.\nVaccinations:  A certification of vaccination for yellow fever and polio are required to enter Equatorial Guinea (EG). The Yellow Fever vaccine should be administered at least 10 days prior to arrival in the country. The EG Ministry of Health requires that all visitors be up to date on the polio vaccine (a booster dose is advised for those who have completed their normal series). It is increasingly common to be asked for proof of vaccination upon entry, and immigration officials may require you to be vaccinated at the airport (potency and sterility of items is always questionable) or bar entry into the country for those who do not comply with the requirements.\nU.S. citizens staying longer than 90 days should register with the local police station.\nPrivate ships landing at Equatoguinean ports must get clearance prior to approaching the shore. \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nCrime:  Though violent crime is rare, instances of violent burglaries/home invasions have occurred. Travelers have encountered anti-foreigner hostility from police and other officials, especially towards those of perceived Western or Chinese descent. Many situations, including petty or street crime and official harassment, have the potential to turn violent.  Security forces may stop people and request money.\nThere has been a significant increase in attacks against women, including U.S. citizens, by small groups posing as taxi drivers and passengers. Victims typically are held captive for up to an hour, threatened at knifepoint, and robbed. Take taxis only in groups, use taxi drivers personally known to you, or avoid taxis altogether, especially in Bata. Be mindful of how much cash you have in your possession when entering a taxi and try to avoid carrying large sums of cash.\nAvoid dark alleys, remote locations, and traveling alone. Carry a copy of your passport and other pertinent documents at all times. Authorities may perceive notarized copies as more official than non-notarized copies.\nPolitical Violence : Demonstrations are not allowed, and therefore are rare. If you encounter a large gathering, avoid the area, as it is likely an illegal demonstration; the police will attempt to disperse the crowd, including through the use of force.\nMaritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continues to increase. Pirates and armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property are common occurrences. Incidents may occur close to coastlines or in open seas. More information on current conditions may be found on the  Office of Naval Intelligence’s piracy page .\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. \nReport crimes to the local police in Malabo at 113 or nationally to the Equatorial Guinean Ministry of National Security at 666-555-532 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+240) 333-095-741 during business hours or (+240) 555-516-008 after hours.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nIt is common to be asked to pay between $50 to $100 in order to file a police report or obtain a copy of a police report on file.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nCell Phones:  Cellular coverage is sporadic, and communication may not be possible outside urban areas.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events. Societal norms do not allow for the public discussion of homosexuality and there have been numerous incidents of harassment and detention of members of the LGB community. No antidiscrimination law exists to protect LGB individuals.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance .  Accommodation for individuals with disabilities is not mandated by Equatoguinean law, and travelers with disabilities are likely to encounter difficulties accessing transportation and public buildings. Although sidewalks often are available in major cities (especially in Malabo and Bata), road crossings are frequently uneven and curbs are usually in need of repair. Neither Malabo nor Bata has a public transportation system, and few vehicles are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Public buildings, including restaurants, bars, medical facilities, stores, and government offices, are rarely accessible and frequently have steps or partially obstructed entrances .\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Rape and domestic violence are illegal in Equatorial Guinea. However, authorities do not enforce the laws effectively.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nCurrency:  Equatorial Guinea is almost exclusively a cash economy. Generally, credit cards and checks are not accepted, with the exception of a few Western hotels that cater to international business travelers and some restaurants and super markets. Credit card cash advances are not available. Most local businesses do not accept travelers' checks, dollars, or euros. However, dollars can be exchanged at local banks for Central African Francs (CFA). Cash in CFA is usually the only form of payment accepted throughout the country.\nATMs are increasingly available in major cities. Although they are generally secure, travelers may find them out of order, so it is best not to rely on ATMs. You should also exercise caution when using a local bank or ATM as individuals may be waiting around to rob individuals with cash. In addition, you should not hail a taxi right outside of a bank or ATM.\nPhotography:  In the recent past, a special permit from the Ministry of Information and Tourism was required for virtually all types of photography in Equatorial Guinea. Although the law has changed, police or security officials may still attempt to fine or detain people taking photographs. Federal laws forbid taking photos of the Presidential Palace and its surroundings, military installations, airports, harbors, government buildings, and any other area the government deems as sensitive. Police and security officials have taken photographers into custody for perceived or actual violations of this policy, or to seize the camera (and/or cell phone) of persons photographing in the country. Also, the police may use this as a reason to try to extort money or threaten foreigners with torture or abuse. As these situations have the potential to become hostile, you should exercise prudence and caution while taking photographs.\nMedical facilities are limited in terms of space and capability. Pharmacies in Malabo and Bata stock basic medicines including antibiotics but do not carry U.S. brand names or generic over the counter (OTC) medications. Outside of these cities, many medicines are unavailable. You should carry a supply of properly-labeled prescription drugs and other OTC medications adequate to cover your entire stay.\nSanitation levels in hospitals are very low, except for the La Paz Malabo Medical Center, a Western level and acute care hospital which meets many of the medical standards of a modern hospital in a developed country. Doctors and hospitals often require immediate payment for health services in cash only (CFA). Patients are sometimes expected to supply their own bandages, linen, and toiletries.\nFor emergency services in Equatorial Guinea, dial 113.\nAmbulance services are not present throughout the country.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  government of Equatorial Guinea  to ensure the medication is legal in Equatorial Guinea.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nWater Quality\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nUse the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays. There are many counterfeit antimalarials throughout Equatorial Guinea and you should not plan on purchasing them after arrival.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Travelers should remain alert for pedestrians and livestock, even on multi-lane highways. Traffic signals and crosswalks are becoming more common but are not always heeded by local drivers. Driving while intoxicated is widespread, particularly at night and during weekends and holidays. At night, many motorists do not use headlights and roads are inconsistently lit. Carry a cell phone for use in case of an emergency. Please note that cell phone coverage can be sporadic at times and outside urban areas.\nTraffic Laws:   U.S. citizens on short stays are permitted to drive with an International Driver’s License. There are currently no distracted driving laws in effect in Equatorial Guinea, but police may pull over drivers who talk or text while driving. They can and will pull over any driver for any reason.\nRoad Blocks and Checkpoints:  Military roadblocks are common outside the limits of Malabo and Bata. Police checkpoints are increasingly common in both cities. You should be prepared to show proper identification (for example, a copy of your U.S. passport) and to explain your reason for being at that particular location. If you do not speak Spanish, carry a Spanish-language written copy of your reason for being in the country and your itinerary, especially if planning to travel into the countryside. Travelers should be aware that many military facilities are poorly marked and inconsistently staffed, especially in isolated areas. Travelers should try to avoid these sites whenever possible.\nPolice or security forces sometimes stop motorists on the pretext of minor traffic violations in order to extort small bribes. We advise you not to pay bribes, and instead request that the officer provide a citation to be paid at the local court or a receipt stating the violation, amount due, and the officer’s name.  If it appears that you may be asked to go to a police station or are held up at roadblocks for an extended period of time, you should contact the U.S. Embassy’s duty officer at +240 555-516-008 to report the situation.\nPublic Transportation: The Embassy prohibits the use of taxis and other forms of public transportation by U.S. citizen employees.\nPublic transportation is not reliable or safe. Taxis, while inexpensive and readily available, are often poorly maintained, and taxi drivers frequently drive dangerously or while impaired. Taxis will stop to pick up additional passengers and may detour or drop passengers off out of sequence. Single travelers, particularly women, should avoid taxis if possible, or use taxi drivers personally known to them or recommended as being safe and reliable. Many taxi drivers do not have a valid driver’s license, have medical conditions that preclude them from driving safely, and/or have no public transportation license. There have been reports from both Malabo and Bata of expatriates boarding taxicabs and being driven to unfamiliar places against their will to be robbed, raped, and otherwise assaulted.\nRental cars are available at the airport through international companies. If you choose to rent a vehicle, be sure to have your registration, passport, and an international driver’s license on you at all times (refer to the Travel & Transportation section above for more information). You may be required to obtain an Equatoguinean driver’s license if you do not have an international driver’s license. Military and police roadblocks are found throughout the country; an official may stop you and ask questions. Some roads will not have pavement.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Equatorial Guinea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Equatorial Guinea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Equatorial Guinea should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the   U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice website .\nU.S.-Eritrean Dual Nationals:  Eritrea does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-Eritrean citizens are considered Eritrean nationals by the Eritrean authorities. This limits our ability to provide consular services for dual nationals.\nDual nationals may be subject to certain obligations, including taxes and conscription into national service.

Rural roads and off-road driving can be dangerous. Traveling by road is also hazardous due to slow motorized carts, pedestrians, bicycles, livestock, fog, poor road maintenance, and poor lighting. There are minefields in certain areas of the country. The roads between Asmara, Massawa, Mendefera, Dekemhare, Barentu, and Keren are paved, but roads to small villages are not. Mountain roads, which are narrow and winding with crumbling edges, generally do not have guardrails or signs, and sometimes have poor visibility of oncoming traffic around hairpin turns. Road debris is common during the rainy seasons, which differ depending on which part of the country you are in. The Filfil Road from Asmara to Massawa has a large amount of mountain debris and has washed away in parts. Wild baboons may be sighted on mountain roads. They are not safe to approach; keep vehicle windows closed and doors closed.\nTraffic Laws:  If you wish to drive in Eritrea, you must obtain an Eritrea driver’s license.

If you are pulled over for a moving violation you are responsible for the consequences. The REPS sets up jaywalking stings which can result in fines and temporary detention for perpetrators. It is recommended that pedestrians use the available ‘zebra crosswalks’ when crossing streets.\nPublic Transportation:  Extreme caution is recommended if using mini-bus taxis, locally known as khumbis, which follow fixed routes and are flagged down by passengers almost everywhere in Eswatini.

Fatal accidents involving these conveyances are very common.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Eswatini, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Eswatini's Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

In late 2020, Ethiopian security officials announced the arrest of al-Shabaab and ISIS members who were accused of planning attacks in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia. Current information indicates that terrorist organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and Western targets and interests in East Africa, as well as against high-profile targets within those countries that contribute troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia, including Ethiopia.\nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: \nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCivil Unrest:  Ethiopia has experienced sporadic and spontaneous civil unrest throughout the country, some of which has ended in violence. During such episodes, the Ethiopian government often curtails or limits mobile telecommunications, internet access, and social media. If this happens, you may be unable to contact family and friends or emergency services. The U.S. Embassy does not provide internet access to private individuals.\nU.S. government personnel must request permission for personal and official travel outside of Addis Ababa and are required to carry personnel tracking devices and, in some cases, satellite phones.\nU.S. government personnel may not take personal trips to:\nU.S. government personnel may only travel to Gambella City and Assosa City by plane. \nWestern areas of Oromia:  Wollega zones that include Kellem Wollega, West Wollega, Horro-Guduru Wollega and parts of East Wollega have reported civil unrest including fighting involving armed groups.\nSouthern areas of Oromia:  West Guji zone has reported civil unrest including fighting involving armed groups.\nEthiopia’s Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region (SNNPR):  Civil unrest in the region, particularly in Bench Sheko Zone and Konso Special Woreda, has resulted in deaths, looting, and the burning of buildings.\nBorder with Kenya:  There have been numerous incidents of inter-ethnic conflict reported near the border areas with Kenya, as well as attacks attributed to the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA or OLF-Shane). Criminal activity in this border area remains a concern.\nTigray and Border with Eritrea:  Due to conflict in the region, Tigray and the border with Eritrea are currently off-limits for U.S. government personnel. Due to the current situation in Tigray, the border roads with Eritrea are closed. Conditions at the border may change with no warning.\nBorder with South Sudan (Gambella Region):  The security situation in the region is volatile. Sporadic inter-ethnic clashes are common along the western border area with South Sudan. Past tribal conflict between Anyuak, Nuer, and Highlanders resulted in numerous casualties. As with other border areas, landmines and criminal activity remain a concern.\nBorder with Sudan:  There have been numerous incidents of armed clashes reported near the border area between Sudan and Ethiopia over disputed land. \n\nSomali Region (eastern Ethiopia):  Al-Shabaab maintains a presence in Somali towns near the Ethiopian border, presenting risk of cross-border attacks and kidnapping. As with other border areas, landmines and criminal activity remain a concern. U.S. government personnel may not take personal trips to the Somali region.\nAfar:  Violent crime, including the armed assault of foreigners, has occurred in the Danakil Depression in Afar. While recent reports may indicate the Danakil Depression area is safe for tourism, please note that tourism was previously targeted for attacks in 2007, 2012, and 2017. It is not recommended to use the Mekelle route to this or other tourist sites in the Afar region due to the current situation in the Tigray region. Travelers should remain alert for changing conditions and the potential for criminal activity in these areas. Travel to areas bordering Tigray is not recommended due to conflict in that region. Additionally, ethnic conflicts between Afar and Somalis in the southern border areas of Afar have been reported.\nAmhara:  As a result of the Tigray conflict, tensions continue to exist along the Amhara-Tigray regional border, with occasional clashes including gunfire. Ethnic violence has been reported. While attacks are mostly related to inter-ethnic disputes and foreigners have not been targeted, attacks can occur at any time with the risk of being caught in violence. If you are travelling in the area, monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.\nCrime in Addis Ababa:  Pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from vehicles and other petty crimes are common in Addis Ababa. Theft of passports is common in Bole International Airport, including inside the airport terminal and during airport transfers. Thieves are active throughout the city at all times, particularly on Bole Road, in the Piazza, the Merkato, and other areas frequented by tourists and foreigners. Violent robberies have also occurred in this area, with victims stabbed or beaten. Further, a number of violent robberies on hikers in Entoto Park, Yeka Park (behind the British Embassy), and the Guellele Botanical Gardens in Addis Ababa have been reported.\nSafety Precautions:\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of crime in Addis Ababa should contact the Addis Ababa Police at 011-111-1011 or 991 from your local cell phone and may call the U.S. Embassy at 011-130-6000/6911. Crimes occurring outside of Addis Ababa should be reported to the Ethiopian Federal Police at 011-126-4359/4377.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Please note that in the event you are arrested and then released on bail, standard practice is that the police will retain foreign passports pending a final hearing. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. \nPhotography:  It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations, police/military personnel, and key infrastructure such as roads, bridges, dams, and airfields. If you are caught photographing prohibited sites, you could be fined, your photographic equipment could be confiscated, and you could be detained and/or arrested. As a general practice, you should avoid taking pictures of individuals without their clear consent.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nPhone Service:  Cellular phones are the main method of communication in Ethiopia; other telephone service is unreliable, and landlines are nearly non-existent. Cell phones brought into Ethiopia must be registered with the Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority. Phones can be registered either at Bole International Airport or at any Ethio Telecom shop. SIM cards are available for local purchase from Ethio Telecom, but will only work with phones that have been registered. As noted, cell phone access may be cut off without warning.\nCurrency:  The Ethiopian Birr (ETB) is the currency of Ethiopia and, with the exception of international hotel bills, payment for commercial transactions in any other currency is illegal. Credit cards are accepted at only a few outlets in Addis Ababa. Foreign currency may only be exchanged legally at banks.\nEthiopian Refugee Camps:  All access to refugee camps must be preapproved by the UNHCR and Ethiopian government. You may be detained and deported if you attempt to gain access without proper permissions.\nCalendar:  The Ethiopian calendar is the principal calendar used in Ethiopia. Some Ethiopians set their clocks differently than is standard practice elsewhere, resulting in significant time differences. Double check bookings and appointments to avoid confusion.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual activity between adults is illegal and punishable by imprisonment under the law. There have been periodic detentions and interrogations of some LGB persons, and alleged physical abuse. Ethiopians do not generally publicly identify themselves as LGB due to severe societal stigma. There are some reports of violence against LGB individuals; reporting is limited due to fear of retribution, discrimination, or stigmatization. There is no law prohibiting discrimination against LGB persons and some LGB activists have reported being followed and at times fearing for their safety. Outside the major international hotels, same-sex couples may be unable to share a room. See our  LGB Travel Information page  and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  See The  Ethiopian Center for Disability and Development  guidebook with information on accessible hotel accommodations and transportation (including the new Addis Ababa metro). Persons with disabilities have limited access to transportation, communication, accommodations, and public buildings. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack functioning elevators. Landlords are required to give persons with disabilities preference for ground floor apartments.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is pervasive. Domestic violence and rape cases often are delayed significantly and given low priority. Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is illegal, but the prohibition is not actively enforced. Many women and girls have undergone FGM/C. It is much less common in urban areas. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nNatural Disasters:  Ethiopia’s geographic location in the western escarpment of the Great Rift Valley and the Horn of Africa increases its vulnerability to natural disasters, including flooding (and related landslides) during the summer rainy season, drought, and seismic events.\nConsult the  CDC website for Ethiopia  prior to travel.\nFor emergency services in Ethiopia, dial the following numbers:\nMedical care is extremely limited and health care facilities are only adequate for stabilization and emergency care. There is a shortage of physicians and other qualified medical personnel, as well as medical supplies, including, but not limited to, respirators, oxygen, and medications.  Emergency, ambulance, and psychiatric services are also limited. All care providers, both public and private, require payment or a cash deposit in Ethiopian birr before treatment is performed.\nAmbulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Addis Ababa. Ambulances are also not generally staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa will not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Some clinics will require payment prior to service or prior to checkout.\nMedical Insurance:   Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See the  Embassy webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. It is strongly recommended that you obtain supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. \nAlways carry your prescription medication in its original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. If the quantity of drugs exceeds that which would be expected for personal use, a permit from the Ministry of Health is required. Check with the Ethiopian Food and Drug Administration (EFDA) at +251-11-552-41-22 or *8484* to ensure the medication is legal in Ethiopia. \nAltitude:   Many cities in Ethiopia, including Addis Ababa, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel.  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about   travel to high altitude locations .\nThe following diseases are prevalent in Ethiopia:\nVaccinations:   Ensure you are up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Note that when traveling to certain other countries from Ethiopia, proof of Yellow Fever vaccination may be required. \nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow  Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of  doctors and hospitals  but does not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nU.S. government officials and their families are advised to travel between major cities by air. They are prohibited from using inter- or intra-city bus transportation and travelling by road outside urban areas at night.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic accidents occur regularly in Addis Ababa and throughout the country. Roads are ill maintained, inadequately marked, and poorly lit. Excessive speed, erratic driving habits, pedestrians, stray animals, and lack of vehicle maintenance pose other hazards. Travel with other vehicles outside of cities during daylight hours only, due to the threat of roadside bandits, and be sure to carry additional fuel, a spare tire, and provisions. Professional roadside assistance service is not available.\nTraffic Laws:  You will need an Ethiopian driver’s license to drive in Ethiopia. In order to obtain an Ethiopian’s driver’s license, you will need an authenticated copy of your U.S. driver’s license. For more information on authentication, visit the  Department of State’s Office of Authentications . The Embassy does not authenticate U.S. driver’s licenses. Use of cell phones while driving is prohibited. Use of seat belts is required. It is illegal to give money to beggars who approach vehicles stopped in traffic.\nAccidents:  In the event of an automobile accident, remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. It is illegal to move your vehicle before a police officer arrives. If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, however, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident.\nPublic Transportation:  Public transport is unregulated and unsafe. Avoid all travel by public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Buses are in poor mechanical condition and are often filled well beyond capacity.\nWhile taxis are available in Ethiopia, most do not meet U.S. safety standards. In Addis Ababa, green and yellow metered taxis are generally newer and in better condition than other taxis. The hiring of private transportation from a reliable source and/or use of hotel provided transportation is recommended.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Ethiopia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Ethiopia’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page ."

There is a lack of medical infrastructure for treating trauma cases, especially those involving extreme sports. Medical evacuation assistance is available only by air. Due to the remoteness of the islands, assistance can take days to arrive and is expensive. There are no daily commercial flights on Chuuk, Yap, or Kosrae.

Use of a mobile phone while driving is illegal. Bicycle riders should be cautious as there is no separate lane for cyclists.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid using minivans and public buses for public transportation, due to safety concerns.   There have been multiple recent reports of public buses catching fire or having severe accidents.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information\nVisit the website of Fiji’s  national tourist office   and  national authority  responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Fiji’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Fiji’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:   The U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the security practices in the ports of Fiji.  Until those concerns can be addressed, the Coast Guard advises that Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Fiji should exercise caution.\nMariners planning travel to Fiji should check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts .  Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport  website, and the  NGA broadcast warnings  website."

If traveling on this emergency passport, you may be refused boarding and/or entry by immigration officials and/or held at the airport until a return flight to the U.S. is available.

Border controls with the United Kingdom, including the Channel Tunnel crossing, have also been reestablished following Brexit.\nThe Government of France routinely conducts security and crisis management drills involving deployment of security forces, emergency services, and police to high profile areas that may be near popular tourist sites. U.S. citizens should be aware of the possibility of drills and should heed instructions of local authorities should they encounter them.\nFrench police and military routinely patrol public spaces. You should expect security inspections (to include purses, bags, and backpacks) at the entrance to large public venues and businesses.\nWhen traveling or living in France, you should:\nCrime:  The majority of crimes directed against foreign visitors, including U.S. citizens, involve pick-pocketing (passports, phones, cash, credit cards), vehicle and residential break-ins, bicycle theft, and other forms of theft.\nVisitors to congested and popular tourist areas (e.g., museums, monuments, train stations, airports, and subways) should be particularly attentive to their surroundings. Rental cars are frequently targeted for break-ins when visitors exit their vehicles and leave valuables behind.\nCrimes of opportunity are more likely to involve violence on the street late at night or when the victim resists. \nExercise extra caution when out alone at night and/or consider traveling out at night with trusted companions.\nWhile the incidence of sexual assault is statistically low, attacks do occur.\nBe aware of “date-rape” drugs, which are present in France. The Embassy has assisted multiple victims who appear to have been targeted using these drugs.\nBe cautious in bars and clubs where alcohol is served, and do not leave your drink unattended or accept a drink from strangers, as they may have slipped drugs into the drink.  \nThere are high incidences of “smash and grab” robberies in economically depressed areas or on highly traveled thoroughfares such as roads to and from the airport. Thieves on foot or motorcycle will approach a vehicle that is stopped in traffic, smash a window, reach into the vehicle to grab a purse or other valuable item, and then flee. Keep doors locked and valuables out of sight.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nDemonstrations  occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nDemonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants.

Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:   You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:   If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. French authorities will not routinely notify the Embassy unless you request them to do so. See our  webpage  for further information.\nControlled Substances:  French law prohibits possession and trafficking of controlled substances and narcotics, including some substances that may be legal to possess under the law of certain U.S. states. More information on controlled substances is available  here . Individuals who violate France’s drug laws may face penalties including prison sentences.\nConvicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. \nIn France and Monaco, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol could result in your immediate arrest and detention.\nFlying Drones:  The use of drones and drone footage in France is highly regulated. It is against the law in France to operate drones over public spaces (including museums, parks, and streets); in urban areas and near airports, military bases, prisons, and nuclear plants; and at large gatherings such as outdoor concerts and parades. France has strict laws to protect an individual’s privacy, thus drone footage is heavily regulated. Violators can be arrested and subject to fines of up to 75,000 euros and/or one-year imprisonment. Review  French government guidance concerning hobbyist drone flights.\nYou should contact the  Embassy of France  or one of  France's consulates  in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. Please see our  Customs Information .\nThere are strict regulations concerning temporary importation or exportation from France of items such as firearms, antiquities, medications, business equipment, merchandise samples, and other items.\nDial 15 to connect to emergency medical services or dial 112 to reach an operator.\nAmbulance services are widely available, though English is not widely spoken.\nMedical care is comparable to that found in the United States.\nExcept for emergency services, you may be required to pay for service prior to receiving treatment in France. Be sure to obtain a “Feuille de Soins” for later reimbursement from your health care provider.\nYou may be refused routine care under local law if you lack the ability to pay.\nForeigners with terminal illnesses may be denied treatment if treatment is available in their home country.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Hospital bills are not itemized.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  government of France  to ensure the medication is legal in France.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended  by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Roads are generally comparable to those in the United States, but traffic engineering and driving habits pose special dangers.\nLane markings and sign placements may not be clear. Drivers should be prepared to make last-minute maneuvers.\nRight-of-way rules differ from those in the United States. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, drivers entering intersections from the right have priority over those on the left, even when entering relatively large boulevards from small side streets.\nBicycles, motorcycles, scooters, and electric skateboards are prevalent on streets, crosswalks and sometimes sidewalks. They have legal priority and often do not respect traffic signals.\nOn major highways, there are service stations at least every 25 miles. Service stations are not as common on secondary roads in France as they are in the United States.\nHighway toll stations may not accept U.S. credit cards. For non-residents, the simplest way to pay is with cash euros at the toll lane marked for that purpose. Do not attempt to use a credit card if it is the only one you have in your possession in case the machine does not return your card.\nTraffic Laws:  While French cities actively encourage bicycle rentals through widely available city-sponsored systems, you should be cautious, especially in a busy and unfamiliar urban environment. Helmets are neither required nor readily available near rental stations. If you plan to ride a bicycle in France, you should bring your own helmet. Though bicycles, scooters and electric skateboards must follow local traffic laws, or risk fines, they often do not do so and can pose a danger to drivers and pedestrians.  Many paths are clearly marked for this form of transportation in  larger cities.\nPedestrian accidents occur when a pedestrian steps out into the street, often when a car or motorcycle is making a turn through a pedestrian crosswalk. Pedestrians should be cautious and aware of traffic even when they have a green walking signal since this is no guarantee against aggressive drivers. Do not assume cars will stop for pedestrians in a crosswalk.\nPublic Transportation:  Paris has an extensive and efficient public transportation system. The interconnecting system of buses, subways, and commuter rails is comparable to or better than that found in major U.S. cities. Similar transportation systems are found in all major French cities.\nIf you use any of France’s public transportation services, take particular care to retain your used or “validated” ticket until you exit the bus, subway, or train station completely, as it may be checked or required for exit. Children over four years of age must have a ticket.\nInspectors conduct intermittent, random checks and passengers who fail to present the correct validated ticket are subject to stiff and immediate fines.  Failing to sign and date or enclose photo (when required) on a tourist pass (Paris Visite) makes the pass invalid and the holder subject to a fine.\nInspectors may show no interest in explanations and no sympathy for an honest mistake. Failure to cooperate with inspectors may result in arrest.\nBetween cities, France has extensive rail service, which is safe and reliable. High-speed rail connects the major cities in France. Many cities are also served by frequent air service. Traveling by train is safer than driving.\nSee our  road safety page  for more information. Visit the website of the  French National Tourist Office  for specific information on French driver's permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, and mandatory insurance. See Embassy of France’s  driving in France  webpage for information on using U.S. driver’s licenses in France.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of France’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of France’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to France should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .

Avoid large gatherings, protests, demonstrations, and any other event where crowds congregate. Police and security forces typically disperse crowds using tear gas or other force.\nCrime:  Muggings, pick-pocketing, and theft of unattended possessions are the most common forms of crime visitors encounter. There have been reports of violent crime, including armed robbery. Vehicle break-ins and residential burglaries continue to be a problem in Libreville and Port Gentil.\nCarry identification at all times to minimize the risk of harassment at police checkpoints.\nAvoid poorly lit streets and unfamiliar areas of the city, especially at night. Avoid beaches after dusk. Carry a minimal amount of cash and avoid wearing flashy or expensive jewelry, especially in markets and nightlife spots. In a robbery, comply with the attacker to avoid injury.\nIn the event of a fire, dial 18 in Libreville.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be certified by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

Non-compliance with such laws may be punished with fines and up to six months’ imprisonment. You should consult a Gabonese lawyer to assure compliance with immigration and residence laws.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nLanguage:  The official language of Gabon is French. English is not widely spoken or understood.\nIdentification:  You should always carry identification and proof of legal immigration status in Gabon. Examples of identification include a residence permit (carte de séjour), U.S. passport, or an authenticated photocopy of your U.S. passport’s biographic information page, and your Gabonese visa. City hall offices in Gabon can authenticate passport photocopies for a nominal fee.\nPhotography:  Taking photographs of the Presidential Palace, airport, and military or other government buildings is strictly forbidden.\nOfficial Corruption:  Official corruption is common, but paying bribes is strongly discouraged and may make you a target for further attempts at securing bribery payments.\nCurrency:  Gabon is largely a cash economy. Credit cards are accepted at only a few major hotels. Due to the high rate of credit card fraud, you should exercise caution when using them. Traveler’s checks can be cashed or dollars exchanged for Central African Francs (CFA) at hotels and banks. ATMs are available in major urban centers and dispense CFA. Exercise caution while withdrawing funds from ATMs.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Gabon. Although there have been no reports of violence against LGB persons, discrimination, including in housing and employment, is a problem. Many LGB individuals choose to keep their status secret, except in trusted circles. Stigma is a likely factor in preventing the reporting of incidents.  \nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and Section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:   Persons with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different in Gabon from what they find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with “physical, mental, congenital, and accidental” disabilities and requires access to buildings or services for persons which such disabilities.

Travelers are routinely stopped at police checkpoints within cities and on roads to the interior. During routine stops, the police may occasionally seek bribes.\nUse extreme caution when driving after dark.  Roads to outlying cities are usually unpaved and in poor condition, with large potholes, absence of road signs, poor to non-existent streetlights, timber-laden trucks, and the presence of pedestrians and animals. Construction work is generally poorly indicated. Drivers may change lanes or stop unexpectedly and lane markings are frequently ignored. Four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended for travel beyond the paved road to Lambaréné, especially during the rainy season.\nRoadside assistance and emergency medical services are available in Libreville, but they may not be dependable. These services are nonexistent outside of the city. Service stations are available along main roads, but vehicle repair facilities are not always available.\nTraffic Laws and Culture:  During short-term tourist or business visits, U.S. citizens may drive a vehicle in Gabon provided they have both a valid U.S. and an international driver’s license. Those residing or working in Gabon (holders of a carte de séjour) must either obtain a Gabonese driver’s license (permis de conduire), or register their U.S. driver’s license with the Direction National de Transport Terrestre.\nThe following items must be kept in the vehicle at all times: the vehicle registration (carte grise), proof of insurance (assurance), proof of vehicle inspection (visite technique), fire extinguisher (extincteur de feu), triangles (triangles), and first aid kit (boite de soins de premiers secours). The police may verify that the driver has all of the required documentation and equipment if they stop a car on the road or at a police checkpoint.\nIt is against the law to use a cell phone while driving in Gabon. \nWhen driving a vehicle or as a passenger in a taxi, you should:\nIf you are driving, while stopped in traffic, scan rearview mirrors to identify potential trouble. If you are idling at a stop light or sign, leave adequate maneuver room between vehicles to allow for a hasty departure if necessary.  Even in daylight, thieves may open unlocked vehicle doors to snatch valuables. Park only in well-lit areas, preferably in parking lots with a security guard.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid public transportation throughout Libreville due to the substantial risk of serious and fatal accidents. Many lack proper safety equipment such as seat belts and headlights and are often overcrowded and unlicensed. Drivers are often reckless, making frequent stops to pick up passengers, drive at high speeds, and ignore traffic or road conditions.\nTaxi safety and maintenance varies widely. Informal, unregulated taxis are common throughout the city.  Select taxis in good condition and verify that there are passenger seatbelts and avoid those in poor condition. Most major hotels will call an official taxi upon request. Unless using a metered taxi, negotiate the fare and request sole use of the taxi with the driver before entering the taxi.\nAn inter-city rail system exists, running from Libreville to Franceville with stops at numerous small cities and towns along the way. \nPlease refer to our  Road Safety page  for more information and seek information from Gabonese authorities responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Gabon, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Gabon’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:   Mariners planning travel to Gabon should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the U.S. Department of Transportation’s  Maritime Security Communications with Industry WebPortal . Information may also be posted to the   U.S. Coast Guard homeport website  and as a broadcast warning on the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s website ."

The fee for a Gambian visa issued through the Gambian Embassy in the United States is currently $200 but is subject to change.  Alternatively, tourists can apply for a visa upon arrival in The Gambia. Tourists are typically granted a 30-day stay in The Gambia upon arrival. The fee for this visa on arrival is currently $108 but is subject to change. You must have at least one blank page in your passport for the stamp. Travelers who stay beyond the allowed time are fined $15 per month of overstay, payable in cash at the airport upon departure. Extensions to stays can be requested at the Department of Immigration in Banjul.\nVisit the  Embassy of The Gambia in Washington DC’s  website for the most current visa information. However, please note that the Embassy of The Gambia’s website is frequently not functioning and current information on visas may be difficult to find.\nTravelers entering and exiting The Gambia are required to pay a $20 security fee upon arrival and departure at the airport, payable in cash (USD or dalasi) only at kiosks.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of The Gambia.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nAvoid the areas of southern Gambia which border the  Casamance region in Senegal , due to potential landmines.\nCrime:  Petty street crime is common. Beware of pickpocketing, purse/bag-snatching, phone-snatching, and theft from vehicles. These crimes occur on ferries, on the beach, in markets and other commercial areas, and in hotels. Ensure that your travel documents, luggage, and valuable items are secure.\nBeware of “bumsters” - local men who approach tourists, particularly on beaches and tourist zones, offering help, to act as local guides or to enter into a relationship. They will often demand payment for their services, even if no agreement has been made. Be polite but firm in turning down unwanted help or attempts at conversation.\nAvoid walking alone, including on beaches, in tourist areas, and after dark.\nDo not display cash and valuable personal property.\nDrive with doors locked and windows closed or rolled up enough at all times to prevent theft while stopped in traffic.\nDemonstrations:  Demonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\nInternational Financial Scams : See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nRelationship fraud/scams:  Internet and in-person friendship, romance and financial scams are prevalent in The Gambia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails, letters, WhatApp, texts, and/or contact initiated in person. Scammers sometimes pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help, others ask for assistance to help them and family members in need. They request financial assistance from victims to help pay for potentially fraudulent or potentially partially valid claims, such as for urgent medical treatment, school fees for numerous relatives, rent payments, car repair, payment of exit taxes, or government fines.\nDo not send money to anyone you have not met in person and whose situation you cannot independently verify.\nIf you believe you might be a victim of an internet or similar scam, it is strongly recommended that you send no money nor gifts and completely disengage from all contact with the individual(s).\nSee  Internet Dating and Romance Scams .\nBusiness fraud/scams:  The U.S. Embassy receives reports of scams in which U.S. businesses sent payment, but did not receive shipments.\nBe suspicious of any unsolicited offers to participate in lucrative business opportunities, especially if they require financial disclosures, money transfers, large up-front investments, or promises of confidentiality.\nCarefully scrutinize all proposals before you commit any funds, provide any goods or services, or undertake any travel.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in addition to Gambian police. Sexual assaults by relatives are often seen by police as family matters outside their jurisdiction and they may not investigate.\nReport crimes to the local police at 117 for police assistance or ambulatory services, and 118 for fire and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(220) 439-2856. The Gambian Police Force operates a 24 hour emergency line at (220) 422-4914. Please be advised that emergency responders may lack fuel for vehicles or face other resource challenges.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  Outside of primary tourist areas in the immediate capital region, formal tourism industry infrastructure is minimal or nonexistent. The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is moderate to minimal in the immediate capital region, and limited to unavailable in much of the rest of the country. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase private  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nConvictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs can result in long prison sentences. This includes use or possession of marijuana.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nDual Nationals:  In addition to being subject to all of The Gambia’s laws affecting foreigners, dual U.S. - Gambian citizens may be subject to additional provisions of Gambian law. Please inquire at a Gambian embassy or consulate regarding your status before you travel. Gambian police routinely do not recognize dual citizenship and may treat you solely as a Gambian citizen. This is particularly true if you use a Gambian passport rather than a U.S. passport to enter The Gambia.\nMedications:  Many common medications are available in Gambian pharmacies although you may need to know the European name or brand to find an equivalent product. Medication, such as insulin, requiring refrigeration may be difficult to store as The Gambia is subject to frequent power outages. You can face fines up to $2,000 and/or three years imprisonment if you arrive with substances containing one percent or more of: hydroquinone (in any form), hydrocortisone (unless in trace amounts and for specific purposes such as anti-itch products), betamethasone, flucinonide, clobestatol, or clobestatone. For more information, including additional restrictions on importing medications, please contact the nearest Gambian embassy or consulate.\nPhotography:  It is against the law to photograph or film airport security operations, military installations, embassies, or government motorcades. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated without notice, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of Gambians without their permission.\nCurrency:  The dalasi is the official currency, though U.S. dollars, euros, and West African Francs (CFA) are accepted in some places. The Gambia is a cash economy; credit cards are accepted only at major hotels when the internet connection is working and a few restaurants. You should only exchange currency at banks or exchange bureaus. Changing money unofficially is prohibited. Due to the potential for fraud, avoid using ATMs except those at banks. Money transfers are widely available at Western Union branch offices.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Under Gambian law, consensual same-sex sexual relations are illegal. Prison terms range from five years to life imprisonment. Antidiscrimination laws do not protect LGB individuals, and there is strong societal discrimination against LGB individuals. Gambian authorities have called on landlords and owners of bars, restaurants, and hotels to monitor activities that happen in their environments.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in The Gambia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, though the law not generally enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Limited accessibility exists in both the capital city area and the surrounding regions.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Although gender-based violence is illegal, many women experience domestic violence. Rape, including spousal, familial, and relationship rape, is a widespread problem. Police generally consider spousal and familial rape to be a domestic issue outside their jurisdiction.\nFemale genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is a crime. Accomplices who are aware of the practice but do not report it to the police can also be punished. Seventy five percent of girls and women have undergone FGM/C, with fifty six percent of girls undergoing this before the age of 15. Seven of the nine major ethnic groups practice FGM/C on girls from shortly after birth until age 16.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in The Gambia, dial  117 .\nAmbulance services are unreliable in most areas, including in the immediate capital region.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments and individuals must then seek reimbursement. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the government of The Gambia, via the nearest embassy or consulate, to ensure the medication is legal.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe government of the Gambia does not require vaccines for citizens of the United States unless they are arriving in the Gambia from a yellow fever zone. Visit the U.S Centers for Disease Control’s website to review their recommendations for  vaccinations  for travelers to the Gambia.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of  doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nGeneral Health:\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nUse the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Resources for Travelers  regarding specific issues in The Gambia.\nWater Quality:\nAir Quality:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions are poor, particularly during the rainy season, which generally lasts from July through September. Although main roads are paved in the greater Banjul area, many are potholed and poorly lit. Some drivers in the Banjul area do not use vehicle lights at night, while others habitually drive with high beams on. Side roads in the Banjul area and most roads outside the Banjul area are unlit and unpaved. Livestock and pedestrians pose road hazards throughout the country, including in the greater Banjul area.\nTraffic Laws:  Numerous accidents are caused by intoxicated drivers. You may be substantially fined or imprisoned if you cause an accident while intoxicated.\nThe police do not consistently apply traffic laws and regulations, and sometimes compel drivers to pay fines on the spot for violations, real or contrived. Written citations/tickets are rarely given.\nPolice periodically set up impromptu traffic stops on major streets to check for drivers’ licenses and proper insurance. You are obligated to stop at all roadblocks or road checkpoints. Do not reverse direction to avoid a road checkpoint or make any movements that security personnel may view as suspicious or provocative.\nGovernment convoys pose serious risks to drivers and pedestrians. Government convoys frequently travel at high speeds and often in either or both lanes of traffic, including in the oncoming traffic lane and do not always use sirens to announce their presence.\nPublic Transportation:  Exercise caution when using taxis, particularly at night. Most taxis lack safety belts and many are not road-worthy.\nWater transportation, including government ferries, is unsafe and unreliable. Ferries, which usually lack sufficient numbers of life preservers for all passengers, are often overcrowded. It is highly recommended that you exit your vehicle quickly after parking to avoid becoming trapped inside for the duration of the crossing. However, this is not always possible, increasing the safety risk. The wooden dugout “pirogues” that also cross the Gambia River often leave shore overloaded. \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of The Gambia’s  national  tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in The Gambia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of The Gambia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to The Gambia should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings .\nPort Security:  The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in The Gambia ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in The Gambia. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of The Gambia should exercise increased caution."

Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nAbkhazia, South Ossetia, and Adjacent Areas:  The United States and most other countries consider these regions part of Georgia. However, de facto local authorities claim independence, and Russian troops and border guards occupy both regions. Attacks, criminal incidents, and kidnappings have occurred in and around the areas. While none of the activity has been anti-American in nature, there is a high risk of travelers finding themselves in a wrong place/wrong time situation. Follow the guidance in our  Travel Advisory for Georgia  and  do not travel   to these regions.  If you choose to travel there, you should be aware:\nPankisi Gorge:  The Department of State cautions U.S. citizens against travel to the Pankisi Gorge region (north of the villages of Matane and Chorale, to the border with Russia, including the city of Duisk) because of the current security environment and the potential for civil unrest. There are restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel traveling to this region or within five kilometers of it. While the Georgian government has had success in combating terrorism within its borders, U.S. citizens should remain vigilant. ISIS recruiting has occurred in Pankisi in the past, and some known terrorists have confirmed ties to the Pankisi Gorge region.  \nCrime : Criminals may target foreigners.

Most dispatchers speak only Georgian and Russian but will transfer calls to English-speaking operators.\nRemember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.  The U.S. Embassy has no law enforcement or legal authority overseas, nor can it investigate crimes in Georgia. U.S. embassy staff are prohibited by federal regulation from acting as agents, attorneys, or in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of U.S. citizens involved in legal disputes overseas.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence : U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.

See our  webpage  for further information.\nNotification to U.S. Embassy Tbilisi of the arrest of U.S. citizens is typically significantly delayed in Georgia. In addition, the Georgian police have the authority under the Administration Violation Code to detain individuals for up to 24 hours without court intervention and 48 hours with court approval (this is referred to as “administrative detention”). There are no due process rights assigned during an administrative hold, meaning the person has no right to counsel.\nSpecial Circumstances : Georgia has strict regulations concerning:\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.

In July 2020, Georgia adopted legislation on the rights of persons with disabilities that establishes principles to guide the government’s implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The government has until this year (2023) to develop an implementation action plan and 15 years to complete accessibility of government buildings, infrastructure, and services.

European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.\nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack –including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  \nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.  \nCrime:  Violent crime is rare in Germany, but can occur, especially in larger cities or high-risk areas such as on large metropolitan subway systems and in train stations, primarily during late night or early morning hours. Most incidents of street crime involve the theft of unattended items and pickpocketing.  Theft and pickpocketing primarily take place at train stations, on public transportation, at tourist attractions, and at large public events.   Always pay close attention to your valuables! \nBe cautious and aware of your surroundings. \nU.S. citizens should exercise caution when congregating in known expatriate hangouts. \nDon’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. They are illegal to bring back into the United States, and you could also be breaking local law. \nDemonstrations:  Demonstrations occur regularly in Germany. Large, public demonstrations take place for a variety of political and economic issues. Demonstrations tend to take place on politically significant holidays like German Labor Day (May 1) and during international summits hosted in Germany.  Demonstration organizers must obtain prior police approval, and police routinely oversee participants.    \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Germany. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Most scammers pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.\nTips to avoid scammers:\nCommon scams include:\nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S.-based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. GPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. Be cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police: in an emergency dial 112 for ambulance and 110 for the police and contact the U.S Embassy or nearest U.S. Consulate (see contact details above). \nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . \nWe can: \nWe also maintain information on our website on how to report  child abuse situations to the local authorities.\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or the Consulates General in Frankfurt or Munich for assistance.

Numerous injuries and deaths occur every year in Germany’s Alpine and coastal regions. Most of the emergencies relate to the following sports:  skiing, hiking, snowboarding, mountain biking, sledding, rock and mountain climbing, paragliding, and swimming. Those engaging in Alpine sports are strongly encouraged to register with  German “Alpen Verein.”\nIn the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.  \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.

Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in some older public transportation, lodging, and general infrastructure, especially outside major cities, but common in most urban infrastructure. Some older buildings and public transportation systems are less adapted to individuals with disabilities.\nCheck your hotel or destination to learn more about options to accommodate disabled traveler needs before visiting Germany.\nThe German National Tourist Board maintains  information about accessibility and disability-friendly travel .\nAll German airports and  Lufthansa  offer services for disabled travelers.\nThe German National Railway,  Deutsche Bahn , maintains a mobility resource webpage.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nGermany has generally high-quality medical care and facilities.

Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nThe Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

Many German traffic laws and traffic signs differ significantly from those in the United States. For more information, please visit the U.S. embassy’s webpage on  driving in Germany .\nSpeed limits are posted on large stretches of the highway, on the Autobahn in urban areas, and when the road has many curves. Although high speeds are permitted on the Autobahn, adverse weather conditions and unfamiliar road markings pose significant hazards. Speed limits are strictly enforced. Use of seat belts is mandatory in front and back seats. Do not park on bike paths or sidewalks. Your vehicle registration, insurance policy, a first-aid kit, a reflective vest, and a reflective triangle must be in your vehicle at all times. In snowy or icy conditions, your vehicle must have snow tires or all-season tires (indicated by M+S marking) or you will be subject to a fine.\nBicycles:  German streets and sidewalks have dedicated bike lanes. Bicycles have priority use of bike lanes over pedestrians and automobiles. Bicyclists also have priority over cars when turning onto side streets. If you are driving, check whether a bicyclist is approaching from either direction before attempting to enter side streets, even when the light is in your favor. You will be held responsible for any injury or damage caused if you turn into a side street and hit a bicyclist using a marked bike lane. If you are walking, watch for bicyclists before crossing or stepping into bike lanes. \nTraffic Laws:  If you are involved in a traffic accident in Germany, even a minor fender-bender, you MUST stay with your vehicle and not leave the scene until police arrive to take a report.

You may be fined, and your driver’s license may be suspended for specified periods of time, depending upon the gravity of each violation. \nPublic Transportation:  Germany has an extensive and safe public transportation network consisting of buses, streetcars, trains, and subways. Metered taxis are also prevalent throughout Germany. Uber and other rideshare companies are available in most cities in Germany. Use common sense safety practices such as guarding valuables and remaining aware of your surroundings on all public transportation. \nStrikes in Germany may disrupt public transportation and travel plans.  We strongly encourage travelers to check transportation schedule information prior to travel.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.

Robberies on highways are of particular concern, especially at night. Armed robbers also sometimes target vehicles coming from Kotoka International Airport. If your car is hit by another car while you are driving, go directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Reports of residential robberies continue to be on the rise.\nStreet crime remains a serious problem in Accra and other large cities. Thieves carry out crimes of opportunity, such as “snatch & grabs,” on city streets in isolated areas as well as from vehicles idling in traffic. Pickpockets are also prevalent in crowded areas.\nLuggage and travel document theft occurs at Kotoka International Airport in Accra and in hotels across Ghana. Keep your documents secure at all times, and don’t leave your baggage unattended. Be wary of all offers of unsolicited assistance at the airport from anyone other than uniformed porters or officials.\nCredit card fraud is common. Exercise caution when using credit and ATM cards in Ghana. It is very common for scammers to tamper with credit card terminals. Skimming is the primary means of credit card fraud, and is undetectable until fraudulent charges appear on statements. If you choose to use a credit card anywhere in Ghana, monitor your credit card activity closely.\nThere are a number of ongoing chieftaincy disputes in Ghana that generally involve competition over limited resources. Several of these disputes have erupted into violence and unrest during recent years. Exercise caution in rural areas and remain alert to outbreaks of unrest.

They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:   See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Ghana. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:  \nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at +233 (0)30-277-3906 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +233-(0)30-274-1000 ext. 1570.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to easily access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nMaritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.\nCriminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. \nPublic smoking is illegal in Ghana. The U.S. Embassy is aware of arrests for cigarette smoking in public places, but has not received reports of prosecutions.\nBe aware that building construction standards are often lower than those found in the United States. These lower standards have contributed to building collapses, fires, and electrical shock.\nIn recent years, U.S. citizens have reported substantial financial losses from questionable transactions involving gold and other precious metals. The Government of Ghana maintains strict regulations on these natural resources. All agents must be licensed and all transactions must be certified.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nSwimming in coastal waters is dangerous and strongly discouraged, even for excellent swimmers. The ocean currents along the coast are powerful and treacherous, and several people drown each year.\nFaith-Based Travelers : See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers : Ghana’s criminal code outlaws “unnatural carnal knowledge,” which is frequently interpreted by local authorities as consensual same-sex sexual relations. This is criminalized as a misdemeanor in Ghana. The U.S. Embassy is aware of arrests and related extortion attempts for such activities, but has not received reports of prosecutions.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance : You may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. Ghana’s Persons with Disabilities Act (2006) explicitly prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, health care, air travel and other transportation, and other domains. The government does not systematically or overtly discriminate against persons with disabilities, but such persons may experience societal discrimination.\nFurthermore, the law provides persons with disabilities access to public buildings “as far as is practical.” However, most buildings, transportation, and educational facilities do not provide for people with special needs. Because many streets are unpaved or not well-maintained, and sidewalks are not prevalent, individuals in wheelchairs or who have difficulty walking face challenges.\nStudents :  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers : Rape is a crime in Ghana punishable by five to 25 years in prison. However, rape is significantly underreported and remains a serious problem. Domestic violence is a crime punishable by up to two years in prison and/or a fine. Police rarely respond to reports of domestic violence.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nMedical facilities in Ghana are limited, particularly outside the capital, Accra. You should carry adequate supplies of any needed prescription medicines, along with copies of your prescriptions, the generic name of the drugs, and a supply of preferred over-the-counter medications.\nMosquito-borne illnesses, such as Malaria, Yellow Fever, and Dengue are a significant problem, and prevention of bites and proper Yellow Fever immunization are important for all areas. \nWhile in Ghana, you should carry and use insect repellents containing either 20 percent DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535; treat clothing and tents with permethrin; and sleep in screened or air-conditioned rooms under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\nRefer to the CDC website for  health information for travelers to Ghana.\nFor emergency services in Ghana, dial 211.\nAmbulance services are:\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.

Secondary roads and many roads outside of major cities are mostly in poor condition. Many accidents occur on the highway from Accra to Cape Coast. Travel in darkness, particularly outside the major cities, is extremely hazardous due to poor street lighting and the unpredictable behavior of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals. Aggressive drivers, poorly maintained vehicles, and overloaded vehicles pose serious threats to road safety.\nScammers may intentionally bump into vehicles and pretend to be hit. They then attempt to extort money from the vehicle’s occupants. Scams of this nature most commonly occur in congested urban areas.\nThere has been an increase in robberies on the highways from Bole-to-Wa and Kintampo-to-Tamale, as well as on other minor roads within parts of the Upper West, Upper East, Northern, Eastern, Bono, Bono East, and Ahafo Regions. Embassy personnel are not permitted to travel at night outside of major cities, and are encouraged to avoid the areas listed in our  Travel Advisory . Remain vigilant, and drive with doors locked and windows up.\nTraffic Laws : Travelers are routinely stopped at police checkpoints throughout Ghana, and vehicles and passengers may be searched. Drivers must possess an international driver’s license (available from  AAA  and the  American Automobile Touring Alliance ) or a Ghanaian driver’s license. When foreign drivers apply for their Ghanaian driver’s license, they may be asked to have their international driver’s license or their home country driver’s license confirmed by their embassy. The U.S. Embassy in Ghana is unable to authenticate such state-issued or international drivers’ licenses, and advises U.S. citizens to contact the  National Identification Authority in Ghana  or have their U.S. driver’s license authenticated in the United States prior to arriving in Ghana.

There is a significant difference between Guatemala City and the rest of the country. \nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:   See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nCustoms:   Guatemalan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Guatemala of items such as antiquities and other cultural property.\nWhen traveling to Guatemala for temporary work related to your profession, if you bring in any technical equipment or tools, you must declare this equipment/these tools upon entry.  The equipment/tools must be of a personal, not commercial, quantity.  You must take the equipment/tools with you when you depart.  If, upon entry, you intend to leave any equipment/tools in Guatemala, you are required to report that to customs authorities and pay import taxes.\nContact the  Embassy of Guatemala in Washington, D.C . ion. (phone: 202-745-4953) or one of Guatemala’s consulates in the United States for specific information.\nThe full range of medical care is available in Guatemala City, but medical care outside of the city is limited. Guatemala’s public hospitals frequently experience serious shortages of even the most basic medicines and equipment. Care in private hospitals is generally adequate for most common illnesses and injuries, and many of the medical specialists working in them are U.S.-trained and -certified. The U.S. Embassy maintains a list of  medical providers and hospitals  on our website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nMany hospitals in Guatemala require payment prior to treating patients, even if personal insurance will cover the treatment.

Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Guatemalan Public Health Ministry  to ensure the medication is legal in Guatemala.\nVaccinations:   Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Road hazards are common.  Secondary and rural roads have little to no illumination.  U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital city at night.  Be vigilant of motorcyclists who weave unexpectedly across lanes of traffic and pedestrians who unexpectedly dart across roads due to the lack of defined crosswalks.\nRobberies of occupied vehicles are common in Guatemala City, often by two assailants on motorcycles who pull up alongside a car stopped at a traffic light.  There have also been numerous reports of violent criminal activity along Guatemala’s main highways, including the Carretera a El Salvador (Inter-American Highway CA-2).\nArmed attacks have occurred in various places in Guatemala, including:\nBetween Tikal and the Belize border; and\nU.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from driving from or through Mexico to Guatemala.\nStay on main roads when traveling to and from Antigua and Lake Atitlan.  Secondary roads in those areas are poorly maintained and have experienced higher incidents of robbery, rape, and armed assault.\nPROVIAL, a roadside assistance force, patrols most of the major highways in the country.  PROVIAL can be contacted by calling +502-2422-7800.  Travelers may also call the police for roadside assistance by dialing 110 or 120, or the fire department by dialing 122 or 123; however, patrols are sporadic.\nTraffic Laws:   Valid U.S. driver’s licenses are accepted for the first 30 days of a visit, and international driving permits are accepted for extended stays.  Laws and speed limits are often ignored, turn signals are rarely used, and passing on dangerous stretches of highway is common.\nIt is against the law for drivers to operate cellular phones while driving.\nPeople found driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs will be arrested and may serve jail time.\nAll drivers involved in accidents resulting in injury may be detained and held in protective custody pending investigation and/or payment of alleged damages.\nPublic Transportation:   The most common form of public transportation is the system of brightly-painted recycled school buses.  Criminal activity and frequent fatal accidents, however, make these low-priced local and inter-city buses particularly dangerous.  U.S. Embassy employees are not permitted to use these public buses.\nUse of radio-dispatched taxis or Uber is far safer than hailing taxis on the street.  In Guatemala City, there are several radio taxi companies in operation:\nU.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from using the white taxis.  The Guatemalan Tourist Assistance Program,  PROATUR , may be able to provide additional information and can be reached by dialing 1500 or +502-2290-2800.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.  Visit the website of Guatemala’s  national tourist office  and national authority responsible for road safety, or contact them via  e-mail .\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Guatemala’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Guatemala’s air carrier operations.  Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:   Mariners planning travel to Guatemala should also check for U.S.   maritime   advisories  and  alerts .  Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

See Victims of Crime section to report incidents.\nDo not accept unsolicited offers of assistance at the airport or hotels as these individuals may be seeking opportunities to rob visitors of their bags, purses, or wallets. You should arrange to be met at the airport by hotel personnel or business contacts.\nKeep car doors locked at all times to prevent carjacking and vehicle intrusion. Only roll car windows down enough to communicate when necessary. Soldiers staffing checkpoints at night and police at intersections during the day will often solicit bribes.

You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards.\nDemonstrations : Political tensions remain high since the 2021 military coup.  Protests around governance, utility and fuel problems, and labor disputes are common, causing disruptions to traffic and commerce.  Some prior protests have escalated into violence.  Demonstrators may attack vehicles that attempt to pass through or around the protests, resulting in serious injuries and vehicular damage. Criminals are known to take advantage of the resulting traffic congestion to rob drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Uniformed security forces may also extort drivers and passengers during these incidents.\nYou should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings.\nScams : See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nCommercial scams are on the rise and can create legal difficulties for U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens have reported being detained by local authorities based on complaints by local business partners and/or as an attempt to extract additional payment. Scams can also target private business personnel and non-governmental organization employees, often with offers to sell diamonds or gold. In general, if an offer sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The funds cannot be recovered.\nOther common scams include:\nVictims of Crime : U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy.\nReport crimes in person at the nearest police station and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(224) 655-10-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence : U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism : No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place.

ATMs are available and credit cards are accepted at some larger hotels and larger supermarkets in Conakry, but should be used only at reputable hotels, stores, and banks. Cash advances on Visa credit cards are available at various branches of BICIGUI, a local bank. Inter-bank fund transfers are possible at BICIGUI branches but can be difficult and expensive.

These limitations are notable across the country.\nStudents : See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers : Rape, spousal rape, and domestic violence are all crimes in Guinea punishable with fines or imprisonment.

Some private medical facilities provide a better range of treatment options than public facilities but are still well below western standards. Trauma care is extremely limited. Food and water safety concerns are among the most common causes of illnesses in the country. Sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, are common.\nFor emergency services in Guinea, dial 117. \nAmbulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas.

People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: \nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals  here . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nBorder Crossings : Most border crossings are controlled jointly by Guinean armed forces, gendarmes, police, and immigration officials, but are lightly patrolled. Complete paperwork and visas are required to cross land borders.\nRoad Conditions and Safety : Guinea’s road network, which is only partially paved, is underdeveloped and unsafe. Roads and vehicles are poorly maintained, road signs are insufficient, and roads and vehicles are frequently unlit. Livestock and pedestrians create constant road hazards. These conditions worsen after dark. During the rainy season, generally from May to October, flash floods can make some roads temporarily impassable. The police and the military often set up roadblocks, making travel within and between cities difficult from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. \nDrivers and passengers of vehicles involved in accidents resulting in injury or death have experienced extra-judicial actions (i.e., mob attacks), official consequences such as fines and incarceration, and/or confrontations with the victim’s family.\nAvoid traveling after dark outside of populated areas due to the risk of roadside crime, roadblocks, and road hazards. Roadside assistance is not available in Guinea.\nTraffic Laws : Drivers in Guinea are generally unaware of traffic laws and routinely ignore road safety rules.\nPublic Transportation : Guinea has no reliable, safe public transportation. Taxis, including small cars and larger vans, are poorly maintained and overcrowded. Taxis frequently stop and start without regard to other vehicles, drive down the wrong side of the road, and weave in and out of lanes. Motorcycles overwhelm the roads and are dangerous to riders and other vehicles and pedestrians. Hired vehicles and drivers are available from agencies at major hotels in Conakry.   \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Guinea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Guinea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel : Mariners planning travel to Guinea should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .

The Bissau-Guinean Embassy in Washington, D.C., suspended operations in January, 2007. The Embassy of Guinea-Bissau does not have a website. Due to Guinea-Bissau’s lack of consular representation in the United States, it can be difficult for U.S. citizens to obtain the required visa for entry into Guinea-Bissau. Since most flights destined for Guinea-Bissau must pass through Dakar, Senegal, or Lisbon, Portugal, most travelers are able to apply for visas at the Bissau-Guinean embassies in those countries.

According to law enforcement officials, travelers should also be cautious of the Mindara and Reino neighborhoods due to crime.\nThe risk of being targeted by criminal actors greatly increases at night, due to Guinea-Bissau`s limited security infrastructure and lack of street and building lighting. Visitors are strongly discouraged from walking after dark, especially alone or in isolated areas. Even during daylight hours and in groups, travelers are advised to maintain a heightened level of security awareness, particularly in public places, tourist areas, and crowded locations.\nCorruption exists at all levels of government.

Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. \nWhile there has been significant progress in locating and removing land mines left in place from Guinea-Bissau’s civil war and war of independence, a substantial number remain. Travelers should not leave designated roads and pathways and should not drive at night. The land mines are scattered in several areas throughout Guinea-Bissau, including the Bafata, Oio, Biombo, Quinara, and Tombali regions.\nPublic Transportation : The public transportation system, urban and rural road conditions, and availability of roadside assistance are all poor.\nExercise caution if using taxis as many are in sub-standard condition. If you do take a taxi, for your safety, inform the driver that you do not want additional patrons to be picked up along the route, as taxis in Bissau serve as a type of bus service, in which each passenger pays for a seat. Furthermore, the Embassy does not recommend that visitors use the informal bus system in Bissau, the “Bus Rapides” or “Toca-Tocas.”\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Guinea-Bissau, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Guinea-Bissau’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Some police stations may have a domestic violence unit; however, not all police officers are trained to handle these cases. U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call the domestic and sexual violence hotline, 914, and contact the Embassy.\nBorder Dispute:   The ongoing dispute about the western border between Guyana and Venezuela has reportedly resulted in assaults, robberies, extortion, and murders in towns on both sides of the border. Fishing villages and mining camps are the most victimized. The Guyanese military and law enforcement lack the capacity to adequately face the challenges in this region.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI   pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at (+592) 225-2700, 226-4585 or (+592) 227-6123, and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+592) 225-4900/9. The local equivalent to the \"911\" emergency line in Guyana is 911.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\n \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nIllegal Drugs:  U.S. citizens should only carry items they personally purchase and pack. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, pre-trial detention can last for years, heavy fines are leveraged, and final sentences are lengthy.\nChanging Currency and Credit Card Use:   Credit cards are accepted in limited locations. Counterfeit U.S. currency is prevalent in Guyana. U.S. citizens should only exchange currency with banks, hotels or licensed money exchange houses.\nFirearms:   Do not enter Guyana with firearms or ammunition without prior express consent from the Guyana Police Force. Visit the  Guyana Police Force ’s and  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  website for more information.\nWildlife:   An export permit is required by the  Ministry of Agriculture  to take an exotic animal or plant out of Guyana, and an import permit is required by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  to bring an exotic animal or plant into the United States.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual relations between men are criminalized in Guyana. It is not uncommon for local police to use the law to intimidate men known or perceived to be gay. There are no laws concerning same-sex sexual relations between women. There is no legal protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation under Guyanese law. See   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Guyanese law prohibits discrimination against disadvantaged persons and persons with disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is difficult for persons with mobility issues. Sidewalks are often unevenly paved. Buses and taxis do not have special accommodations. Newer buildings/ buildings in the city are more likely to have ramps, reserved parking, and accomodating sanitary facilities.\nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nThe Government of Guyana requires all non-Guyana citizens ages 18 and over entering the country to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. \nThe quality of medical care in Guyana remains low and inconsistent. Emergency care and hospitalization for major medical illnesses or surgery are limited due to lack of trained specialists and poor sanitation.\nThe tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Almost 80 percent of Guyana’s territory is covered by forest, beyond the area of paved roads. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide medical treatment.\nPurchase medical evacuation insurance in advance of travel. See our webpage for more   information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nFor emergency services in Guyana, dial 913.\nHealth facilities in general:   Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” or proof of insurance prior to service or admission. Most hospitals and medical professionals require cash payment.  Psychological and psychiatric services are limited.\nAmbulance Services:    Are not widely available, especially in remote parts of the country. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulance services are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and are not staffed with trained paramedics and/or often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers are often taken to nearest hospital by taxi or private vehicle.\nMedical Insurance:   Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nPrescriptions:   If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Guyana to ensure the medication is legal in Guyana. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nGeneral Health Language\nThe following diseases are present:\nUse the  CDC recommended insect repellents  and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers, even for short stays.\nWater Quality:  In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of  doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.  \nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Road conditions in Guyana differ significantly from those in the United States. Main roads are generally marked, though they often have potholes. Secondary rural roads tend to be narrow, are sometimes inadequately marked, and have potholes. Exercise caution when driving in Guyana and avoid driving after dark. Road accidents are common and sometimes severe. Drivers, especially those who drive public transportation, can be erratic and display disregard for road safety laws.\nIf an accident occurs, call 911 for the police and 913 for an ambulance. These numbers may not always be operational, that the police may be slow to respond. An ambulance may not always be available.\nFor more information about traveling in Guyana, visit the  Guyana Tourism Authority website .\nTourism Safety:  All travelers visiting Guyana should use only Guyana Tourism Authority approved tour companies and ensure any sub-contracted company or guide is also approved by the Guyana Tourism Authority.  A list of approved operators is published on the website of Ministry of Tourism, Industry, and Commerce at  Approved Tour Operators – MINTIC . Travelers should be diligent and closely follow the safety protocols administered by the tour operators and take reasonable steps to protect safety.  We highly recommend travelers wear a personal flotation device that meets U.S. Coast Guard standards and carry appropriate  communication equipment when engaging in water activities (link:  https://www.nrs.com/learn/is-your-life-jacket-safe ).  U.S. embassy personnel are required to use only tour companies approved by the Guyana Tourism Authority and to follow their administered safety protocols.  \nTravel in the Interior:  The interior of Guyana is under-policed, emergency services are generally not available, and there is no cellular phone reception in many places. Dirt roads in the interior may be impassable during the rainy season. Travelers visiting the interior should consider bringing their own safety gear, such as life jackets, first aid kits, and communications equipment (e.g., a satellite phone).\nTraffic Laws:   The use of seatbelts is required by law. There are no laws concerning the use of child car seats. Anyone on a motorcycle must wear a protective helmet. Talking on the cellular telephone while driving without using a hands-free set is illegal.\nPublic Transportation:   Small buses, called “mini-busses” are privately owned, often crowded and tend to travel at excessive speeds. Avoid privately owned minibuses, as drivers frequently drive erratically. Taxis are generally safer to use. Use taxis that are connected to major hotels or that are painted yellow, which indicates they are registered with the Guyana Taxi Association.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. The entity responsible for road safety in Guyana is within the  Guyana Police Force . They can be reached at (+592) 227-2349.\nPrivate roadside assistance is available through local Guyanese insurance companies. For travel outside of Georgetown, roadside assistance may be delayed or unavailable.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Guyana, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Guyana’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nAirlines typically operate based on demand and can therefore delay, reroute, or cancel flights without notice. U.S. citizens should carry medication, valuables, and perishables in carry-on luggage.\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Guyana should also check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts . Information may also be posted to the   U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

Visit the  Embassy of Haiti  website for the most current visa information.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:   The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Haiti.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nCrime:  Embassy employees are prohibited from using public transportation and visiting certain areas of Port-au-Prince due to high crime. Political violence and violent crimes are common in Haiti, including murders, kidnappings, robberies, assaults, vehicle break-ins, and home invasions. Travelers are often targeted, followed, and violently attacked and robbed shortly after leaving the Port-au-Prince international airport. For this reason, Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling in personal vehicles to and from the airport. Also, the Embassy has procedures in place to detect surveillance and deter attacks on its employees.\nLabadee, a port near Cap Haitien in the north - only accessible by cruise ship passengers - has private security and lower rates of reported crime. Travelers should exercise heightened  precautions,however, due to increasing insecurity nationwide.\nSafety Precautions:\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault:  Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. Police investigations may not meet U.S. standards and forensic medical services are very basic. While rape kits exist in Haiti, there is generally no capacity to collect or utilize samples for police investigation. Report crimes to the local police at (+509) 3838-1111 or (+509) 3733-3640, then call the U.S. Embassy at (+509) 2229-8000.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDemonstrations  occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nDomestic Violence:   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:\nNo formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level in most locations.  With the exception of Labadee, tourists are participating in activities at their own risk.  Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage\nHurricanes:  Hurricane season runs from June 1 – November 30 in the Atlantic. Roads and bridges may become impassible. Poor rescue services and weak infrastructure hamper the government’s ability to respond to storms.\nFor information on how to prepare and respond to storms and hurricanes:\nEarthquakes:  Haiti is prone to earthquakes. For information on what to do before, during, and after an earthquake, visit  https://www.ready.gov/earthquakes .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Prolonged pre-trial detention is common and prison conditions do not meet U.S. standards. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law.  For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:   If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.  See our  webpage  for further information.\nReal Estate Investments:  Be highly cautious. Property rights are irregularly enforced. Clear title to land is difficult or impossible to obtain. Consult an attorney before signing documents or closing on any real estate transactions. Undeveloped land is vulnerable to legal and physical takeover. Absentee owners may be assaulted by squatters when trying to reclaim their property. Litigation and eviction proceedings can take years. U.S. citizens involved in business/property disputes are sometimes arrested without charge and can spend months or years in pre-trial detention, waiting for their cases to be heard. The Embassy does not attend property dispute hearings but, as above, can assist U.S. citizens who have been arrested.\nFirearms and Other Weapons:  Possession of firearms, ammunition, and dangerous weaponry is strictly prohibited to any person, unless the individual has a Haitian license or has been specifically authorized by Haitian authorities.  In order to bring a firearm into Haiti, an owner must obtain written permission in advance from the Director-General of the Haitian National Police (HNP).  Contact the “Centre de Renseignement de la police”/Information Center (CRO) at  cropnh@yahoo.fr  or by telephones at 509-3838-1111 /509-3837-1111/509-3839-1111 for additional information.  Travelers caught entering Haiti with any type of weapon, including firearms or ammunitions, will likely face severe penalties, including prison time. U.S.-issued permits allowing an individual to carry weapons are not valid in Haiti.  Visit the Department’s  Traveling Abroad with Firearms webpage .\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:   Anti-LGB sentiment exists. While no laws criminalize sexual orientation or consensual same-sex conduct between adults, persons identified as LGB may be targeted for harassment, discrimination, or physical attacks. See   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:   The law in Haiti prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the law is not enforced.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States, however.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.  Businesses rarely accommodate persons with disabilities and Haitian authorities do not enforce laws mandating public access for the disabled. Sidewalks, when present, are frequently congested by sidewalk commerce and parked cars.\nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:   Domestic violence and sexual assault are unfortunately common and not always investigated or prosecuted consistently or vigorously. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nThe Government of Haiti requires all non-Haiti citizens age 12 and over entering the country to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, or to present a negative COVID test. \nMedical facilities, including ambulance services, are scarce and generally sub-standard, especially outside the capital. Life-threatening emergencies often require evacuation to a point outside of Haiti by air ambulance at the patient's expense.  Lists of doctors, hospitals, and air ambulance services  are available at the Embassy website.\nThere is no functional national emergency services line in Haiti. The Embassy maintains a  list of emergency telephone contacts.\nAmbulance services may not be reliable in an emergency. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Ambulance services are:\nWe do not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:   Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the  Haitian Ministry of Public Health  to ensure the medication is legal in Haiti.\nVaccinations:   Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nHealth facilities in general:\nWater Quality\nIn most areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested.  Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\nGeneral Health Language\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:    Traffic is extremely chaotic throughout the country and is frequently congested in urban areas. Lanes are not marked, and signs indicating the flow of traffic seldom exist. Roads are generally unmarked, and detailed, accurate maps are not widely available. GPS-based systems do usually work accurately, but the lack of road signage makes it hard to determine the indicated route. There are only a handful of stoplights in the country. Pedestrians regularly walk on the side of the road, and animals often dart into traffic. Even though driving is on the right side of the road, large potholes and flooding may cause drivers to swerve unpredictably and dangerously into the opposite lane of traffic. Speeding, aggressive driving, lack of traffic lights and signs, lack of right of way, unlit vehicles, and poor maintenance are the cause of many fatal traffic accidents in Haiti, as are overloaded vehicles on winding, mountainous and degraded roads. Motorcycles weave through traffic at high speeds. Driving under the influence is common at night. Traffic accidents are a major cause of death and injury, and extreme caution should be exercised. Those lacking knowledge of Haitian roads and traffic customs should hire a driver through a tour company or hotel. Heavy rains can cause mudslides and flooding that can quickly make conditions perilous. The Haitian government lacks adequate resources to assist drivers in distress or to clear the road of accidents or broken-down vehicles. If you are involved in an accident, do not expect medical or law enforcement assistance.\nPublic Transportation:   Public transportation consists of “tap-taps” (collective buses), private motorcycles for hire, and public buses and taxis in some cities or inter-city routes. Embassy personnel are prohibited from using any public transportation, and U.S. citizens are advised to avoid doing so due to the risk of crime. There is a significant risk of ejection in any accident, or even rough driving, due to lack of seat belts.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Haiti’s Civil Aviation Authority as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Haiti’s air carrier operations.  Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Haiti should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .  Information may also be posted to the   U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

The U.S. Embassy has restricted U.S. government personnel travel to Gracias a Dios. U.S. citizens should not travel to Gracias a Dios. The Honduran government conducts police and military patrols in major cities in an effort to reduce crime. However, the ability of Honduran law enforcement authorities to prevent, respond to, and investigate criminal incidents, and to prosecute criminals is limited.\nBay Islands and Copan Ruins \nAreas frequented by tourists, such as the Bay Islands (including Roatan, Utila and Guanaja) and Copan Ruins, have a higher concentration of law enforcement resources; however, crime remains a concern in these areas, particularly relating to drugs, robbery, and illegal possession of firearms. Travelers should still exercise reasonable precautions.  Foreign residents of the Bay Islands who purchase properties have reported increased incidents of harassment, including being the victims of violent attacks, after becoming involved in disputes.\nReview your personal security plans; remain aware of your surroundings and local events; and monitor local news stations for updates. Maintain a high level of vigilance, take appropriate steps to enhance your personal security, and follow instructions of local authorities.\nRead the  Travel Advisory for Honduras  for additional information.\nDemonstrations:   Demonstrations regularly occur in Honduras, particularly near the Presidential Palace, Congress, and the universities in Tegucigalpa. Protests and work stoppages have become common at  Ministerio Publico  offices   throughout the country, leading to interruptions in services. Additionally, some protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. In addition, there are often demonstrations on the CA-5, the main highway connecting Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. This highway is used to access or exit Palmerola International Airport – XPL, near Comayagua (54 miles north of Tegucigalpa). Palmerola is currently the main international airport for Tegucigalpa. Protests often result in the extended closure of major roads and highways in and between major cities, blocking the flow of goods, services and reducing access to daily household supplies. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Honduras should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches. \nVictims of Crime:  If you are a victim of crime, call the national police by dialing 911. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nAlso contact the U.S. Embassy at 011-504-2236-9320 or 011-504-2238-5114 (and after-hours at 011-504-2238-5114). We can:\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\nSevere Weather:  Honduras is vulnerable to hurricanes, heavy rains, and flooding, especially between June and November. For up-to-date information, visit Honduras’ National Emergency Management Commission ( COPECO ) website for current alerts, as well as the  National Hurricane Center’s website .\nScams:  See the  Department of State  page for information on scams.\nTourism:  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.\nState of Exception:   In December 2022, the Government of Honduras declared a “State of Exception.” There may be restrictions on freedom of movement and other rights under this State of Exception in 17 of the 18 Departments in Honduras. Monitor local media for updates and information on restrictions in specific cities and neighborhoods. \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. It is important for all U.S. citizens in Honduras to be aware that Honduran legal procedures and traditions differ greatly from those to which most Americans are accustomed.\nJudicial procedures are not always clear or easily understood by foreigners, and significant delays during the investigation and trial dates are common. U.S. citizens, as well as Hondurans, are often held in jail for months, and sometime years, while awaiting trial. \n \nFurthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nSpecial circumstances:\nCustoms Regulations:  Strict regulations apply to the import and export of items such as vehicles, medications, and business equipment.  Honduran law prohibits the export of artifacts from pre-colonial civilizations, as well as certain birds and other flora and fauna.  For specific information, contact the Embassy of Honduras in Washington, DC and see our  Customs Regulations . \nIndividuals found to be in possession of illicit drugs, firearms, or more than $10,000 in currency are likely to be arrested and face prosecution by Honduran authorities. Fines for carrying more than $10,000 in undeclared currency can exceed one third of the total amount of currency carried by the traveler.\nMedication and Medical Equipment:  Medical brigades traveling to Honduras are advised that they need to complete customs forms, as well as medical clearance forms, at least three business days prior to brining medications or medical equipment into the country. U.S. citizens taking part in medical missions to Honduras should contact Aduanas Honduras ( www.aduanas.gob.hn ) and ARSA ( https://www.arsa.gob.hn/ ) for information regarding the timeline for customs approval, the forms that are required, and restrictions on the types of medications and equipment that are allowed.\nFirearms:  No one may bring firearms into Honduras, except for diplomats and other official travelers, or individuals participating in sporting events who have obtained a firearm permit from the Honduran Ministry of Security or Ministry of Defense prior to travel. Individuals who attempt to bring firearms into Honduras without an appropriate permit, will face prosecution for criminal possession and possibly trafficking of firearms.\nMarine Safety and Oversight:   Honduran military personnel commonly board private vessels in Honduran territorial waters to verify crew and passenger documentation. Criminals have been known to pose as fisherman and commit armed assaults. If your vessel is hailed by a suspicious vessel, contact the U.S. Coast Guard by radio or INMARSAT at (305) 415-6800. U.S. citizens arriving to Honduras by sea, whether by private vessel or cruise ship, are subject to the same laws as other travelers.\nWatersports:  Strong undertows and currents make swimming at Honduras’s Pacific Coast beaches extremely dangerous even for experienced swimmers. Most beaches do not have lifeguards nor signage. If a lifeguard is present, follow their instructions. Honduras’s search and rescue capabilities are limited, and access to medical resources in beach areas is inadequate. Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities and consider your physical capabilities and skills. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination.\nInvestment:   Many U.S. firms and citizens operating in Honduras have found corruption to be a serious problem. Due to poor regulation, financial investments pose high risks and have led to substantial losses.\nExercise extreme caution before investing in real estate. Fraudulent deeds are common and have led to numerous disputes. In addition, threats and violence have been used against U.S. citizens involved in property disputes. Numerous U.S. citizens have reported significant delays in resolving judicial cases and/or lack of cooperation from courts and the legal system.  \nFor further information, review the State Department’s Investment Climate Statement and the  U.S. Embassy’s information page on purchasing property in Honduras .\nAdventure Sports:   There is little to no oversight of safety standards in Honduras. You should research service providers to ensure they are using internationally acceptable or certified equipment, guides, safety measures, and instruction.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB\nTravelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Honduras. However, many activists report that crimes committed against the LGB community go unpunished. There have also been cases of police harassment of patrons in LGB nightclubs. LGB travelers should exercise caution, especially when expressing affection in public.\nSee   our  LGB travel information  page and section 6 of the  Department of State's Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Honduran law requires access to buildings for persons with disabilities; however, few buildings are accessible. Please review the information on the  State Department’s Traveling with Disabilities website .\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nStaff, facilities, and supplies in Honduras often do not meet U.S. medical standards. There are adequate facilities in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula for advanced surgical procedures in case of non-elective emergencies.\nHonduras lacks the infrastructure to maintain water purity and food safety. Diarrheal illness is very common even in large cities and luxury accommodations. Only sealed commercial water containers (bottles) are considered safe to drink.\nAir pollution can aggravate or lead to respiratory problems during the dry season due to widespread forest fires and agricultural burning. Dry season varies and can occur from February to May. The agricultural fires can cause the air quality to reach unhealthy and even hazardous levels based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.

Consider saving these documents to your mobile phone in case of emergency. If your passport is lost or stolen, copies will help you apply for a replacement passport and an exit permit from the Indian government. Replacing a lost visa, which is required to exit the country, may take several business days.  \nU.S. citizens of Pakistani origin or descent are subject to administrative processing and should expect additional delays when applying for Indian visas.\nForeign citizens who visit India to  study, do research, work, or act as missionaries, as well as all travelers and residents planning to stay more than 180 days, are required to register their visit or residency within 14 days of arrival with the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO)  closest to where they will be staying, in addition  to having the appropriate visa  when they enter India. Similarly, if you are traveling to India to give birth, you must register your newborn’s birth within 14 days with the FRRO office.  Failure to do so will result in fines, fees, and penalties.

Please verify this information with the  Embassy of India  before you travel.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nU.S. citizens should always practice good personal security and situational awareness. Be aware of your surroundings. This includes local customs and etiquette. Keep a low profile. Monitor local news reports, vary routes and times in carrying out daily activities, and consider the level of security present when visiting public places, including religious sites, and when choosing hotels, restaurants, and entertainment and recreation venues.\nIndia intermittently experiences terrorist and insurgent activities which may affect U.S. citizens directly or indirectly. Some U.S.-designated terrorist groups are active in India, including Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e Tayyiba. The U.S. government occasionally receives information regarding possible terrorist attacks that could take place in India, monitors such information to determine credibility, and advises U.S. citizens accordingly. Enroll in the  Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)  to receive messages from the Embassy automatically.  \nPast attacks have targeted public places, including some frequented by Westerners, such as luxury and other hotels, trains, train stations, markets, cinemas, mosques, and restaurants in large urban areas. Attacks have taken place during the busy evening hours in markets and other crowded places but could occur at any time. Alerts are usually more frequent around major holidays. The Maoists (also known as “Naxalites”) are the most active insurgent group in India. The Naxalites typically attack Indian government officials, but have also derailed trains, targeted other government buildings such as police stations, and conducted other criminal activity. \nDemonstrations and general strikes, or “bandh,” often cause major inconvenience and unrest. These strikes can result in the stoppage of all transportation and tourist-related services, at times for 24 hours or more. U.S. citizens caught in such a strike may find they are unable to make flight and rail connections, as local transportation can be severely limited. Local media generally give an idea of the length and geographical location of the strike. You are urged to obey any imposed curfews and travel restrictions and avoid demonstrations and rallies as they have the potential for violence, especially immediately preceding and following political rallies, elections, and religious festivals (particularly when Hindu and Muslim festivals coincide). Tensions between castes and religious groups can also result in disruptions and violence. \nThere are active \"anti-conversion\" laws in some Indian states, and acts of conversion sometimes elicit violent reactions from Hindu extremists. Foreigners suspected of proselytizing Hindus have been attacked and killed in conservative, rural areas in India in years past. In some cases, demonstrators specifically block roads near popular tourist sites and disrupt train operations in order to gain the attention of Indian authorities; occasionally vehicles transporting tourists are attacked in these incidents. You should monitor local television, print and social media, and Mission India’s American Citizens Services  Facebook  page\nSwimming:  You should exercise caution if you intend to swim in open waters along the Indian coastline, particularly during the monsoon season. Every year, people in Goa, Mumbai, Puri (Odisha), off the Eastern Coast in the Bay of Bengal, and other areas drown due to strong undertows. It is important to heed warnings posted at beaches and to avoid swimming in the ocean during the monsoon season. Several years ago, there were reports of fatal crocodile attacks in the Andaman Islands. Trained lifeguards are very rare along beaches.\nWildlife Safaris:  Many tour operators and lodges advertise structured, safe excursions into parks and other wildlife viewing areas for close observation of flora and fauna. However, safety standards and training vary, and it is advisable to ascertain whether operators are trained and licensed. Even animals marketed as “tame” should be respected as wild and extremely dangerous. Keep a safe distance from animals at all times, remaining in vehicles or other protected enclosures when venturing into game parks or safaris.\nTrekking:  Trekking expeditions should be limited to routes identified for this purpose by local authorities. Use only registered trekking agencies, porters, and guides, suspend trekking after dark, camp at designated camping places, and travel in groups rather than individually. Altitudes in popular trekking spots can exceed 25,000 feet (7,620 m); please ensure you are fit to trek at these altitudes and carry sufficient medical insurance that includes medical evacuation coverage.\nTrain Travel:  India has the third largest rail network in the world, and train travel in India is generally safe. Nevertheless, accidents and on-board fires are sometimes caused by aging infrastructure, poorly maintained equipment, overcrowding, and operator errors. Train accidents and fires have resulted in death and serious injury of passengers.\nAreas of Instability: Jammu & Kashmir:  The Department of State recommends that you do not travel to the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir because of the potential for terrorist incidents as well as violent public unrest. A number of terrorist groups operate in the territory targeting security forces, particularly along the Line of Control (LOC) separating Indian and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, and those stationed in primary tourist destinations in the Kashmir Valley: Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. Foreigners are particularly visible, vulnerable, and at risk. In the past, serious communal violence left the territory mostly paralyzed due to massive strikes and business shutdowns, and U.S. citizens have had to be evacuated by local police. The Indian government prohibits foreign tourists from visiting certain areas along the LOC (see the section on Restricted Areas, below) and may require a travel permit to enter this area.\nIndia-Pakistan Border:  The Department of State recommends that you do not travel to areas within ten kilometers of the border between India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on both sides of the border. The only official India-Pakistan border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the state of Punjab between Atari, India, and Wagah, Pakistan. The border crossing is usually open, but you are advised to confirm the current status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel. A Pakistani visa is required to enter Pakistan. Only U.S. citizens residing in India may apply for a Pakistani visa in India. Otherwise, you should apply for a Pakistani visa in your country of residence before traveling to India.\nBoth India and Pakistan claim an area of the Karakoram Mountain range that includes the Siachen glacier. Travel or mountain climbing in this area is highly dangerous. The disputed area includes the following peaks: Rimo Peak; Apsarasas I, II, and III; Tegam Kangri I, II and III; Suingri Kangri; Ghiant I and II; Indira Col; and Sia Kangri. Check with the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi for information on current conditions.\nNortheastern States:  Incidents of violence by ethnic insurgent groups, including bombings of buses, trains, rail lines, and markets, occur sporadically in the northeast. While U.S. citizens have not been specifically targeted, it is possible that you could be affected as a bystander. If you travel to the northeast, you should avoid travel by train at night, travel outside major cities at night, and crowds. U.S. government employees at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India are prohibited from traveling to certain areas in the states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur without permission from the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata. Restricted Area Permits are required for foreigners to visit certain Northeastern states (see the section on Restricted Areas, below.) Contact the U.S. Consulate General in Kolkata for information on current conditions.\nEast Central and Southern India:  Maoist extremist groups, or “Naxalites,” are active in East Central India, primarily in rural areas. The Naxalites have a long history of conflict with state and national authorities, including frequent terrorist attacks on local police, paramilitary forces, and government officials, and are responsible for more attacks in the country than any other organization through an ongoing campaign of violence and intimidation. Naxalites have not specifically targeted U.S. citizens but have attacked symbolic targets that have included Western companies and rail lines. While Naxalite violence does not normally occur in places frequented by foreigners, there is a risk that visitors could become victims of violence.\nNaxalites are active in a large swath of India from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal, particularly in rural parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and on the borders of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and Odisha. Due to the fluid nature of the threat, all U.S. government travelers to states with Naxalite activity must receive authorization from the U.S. Consulate responsible for the area to be visited, unless they are only visiting capital cities.\nRestricted/Protected areas:  Certain states or portions of states require Restricted Area Permits. These include:\nMore information about travel to/in restricted/protected areas can be found from India’s  Bureau of Immigration .\nRestricted Area Permits are available outside India at Indian embassies and consulates abroad, or in India from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Foreigners Division) at Jaisalmer House, 26 Man Singh Road, New Delhi. The states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim maintain official guesthouses in New Delhi, which can also issue Restricted Area Permits for their respective states for certain travelers. While visiting Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) in Tamil Nadu, you should be aware that the Indira Gandhi Atomic Research Center in Kalpakkam is located just south of the site and is not clearly marked as a restricted and dangerous area.\nFor the latest security information, travelers should enroll in  STEP  to receive updated security information and regularly monitor travel information available from the  U.S. Embassy in New Delhi  as well as the U.S. Consulates General in  Mumbai  ,  Chennai ,  Hyderabad , and  Kolkata .\nCrime:  Violent crime, especially directed against foreigners, has traditionally been uncommon. Petty crime, especially theft of personal property (including U.S. passports), is common, particularly on trains or buses, at airports, and in major tourist areas. Pickpockets can be very skilled and travelers have reported having their bags snatched, purse-straps cut, or the bottom of their purses slit without their knowledge. If traveling by train, lock your sleeping compartments and take your valuables with you when leaving your berth. If you travel by air, be careful with your bags in the arrival and departure areas outside airports. Be cautious about displaying cash or expensive items to reduce the chance of being a target for robbery or other crime, and be aware of your surroundings when you use ATMs. Scammers have used ATM card scams to clone credit card details and withdraw money.\nIndividuals have reported cases of sexual assault, including rape, against U.S. citizens traveling throughout India.\nThe U.S. government cautions citizens, especially women, not to travel alone in India. Please observe stringent security precautions. When traveling without known and trustworthy companions, use public transport specifically designated for “women-only” travelers, which is a free service offered by the Indian government in many metropolitan cities including Delhi and Hyderabad. Please restrict evening entertainment to well-known venues and avoid isolated areas when traveling alone at any time of the day. Keep your hotel room number confidential and make sure hotel room doors have chains, deadlocks, and peep holes. Travel with groups of friends rather than alone. In addition, only hire reliable cars and drivers and avoid traveling alone in hired taxis, especially at night. Use taxis from hotels and pre-paid taxis at airports rather than hailing them on the street. If you encounter threatening situations, call “100” for police assistance (“112” from mobile phones). If you use app-based services like “Uber” or “Ola” share your ride information with a friend.\nTravelers in India are advised to respect local dress and customs. Indian women typically wear conservative everyday dress. This is the norm throughout the country, and even more so in rural areas. They wear clothing that covers their legs and shoulders. Exceptions are vacation resorts catering to foreign clientele and some neighborhoods of major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. Western women, especially those of African descent, continue to report incidents of verbal and physical harassment by individuals and groups of men. Known locally as “Eve-teasing,” these incidents of sexual harassment can be quite frightening and quickly cross the line from verbal to physical. Sexual harassment can occur anytime or anywhere, but most frequently has happened in crowded areas such as in marketplaces, train stations, buses, and public streets. The harassment can range from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to catcalls to outright groping.\nThe Government of India has focused more on addressing gender-based violence. One outcome has been more reports of sexual assault nationwide. Indian authorities report rape is one of India's fastest growing crimes.\nIf you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you should call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can sometimes connect you with an Indian non-governmental organization that may be able to provide assistance.  \nPlease review our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nIf you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States. For further information, visit the  U.S. Department of Justice page for violence against women.\nScams are common at major airports, train stations, popular restaurants, and tourist sites. Scam artists prey on visitors by creating distractions. Be careful of taxi drivers and others. This includes train porters. They solicit travelers with \"come-on\" offers of cheap transportation and/or hotels. Travelers who accept such offers are often the victims of scams. These include offers to help with \"necessary\" transfers to the domestic airport, overpriced hotel rooms, unwanted \"tours,\" unwelcome \"purchases,\" long cab rides, and even threats when the tourists decline to pay. Tourists have reported being lured and extorted for money in the face of threats of violence against the traveler and his/her family members. Be careful when hiring transportation and guides. Use only well-known travel agents to book trips.\nSome vendors sell carpets, jewelry, and gemstones. These items may be expensive and not of the promised quality. Deal only with reputable businesses and do not hand over your credit cards or money unless you are certain that goods being shipped are the goods you purchased. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it is best avoided. Most Indian states have official tourism bureaus set up to handle complaints. Do not agree to transport any goods on behalf of strangers in exchange for money.\nIndia-based criminals use the internet to extort money from victims abroad. In a common scam, the victim develops a close romantic relationship with an alleged U.S. citizen they meet online. When the “friend” travels to India, a series of accidents occur and the victim begins to receive requests for financial assistance, sometimes through an intermediary. In fact, the U.S. citizen “friend” does not exist; they are only online personas used by criminal networks. Victims have been defrauded of thousands of dollars in these schemes. Do not send money to anyone you have not met in person and carefully read the Department of State’s advice on   international financial scams . \nIn another common scam, family members in the United States, especially older people, are asked for money. The scammers claim to be grandchildren or relatives who have been arrested or are without money to return home. Do not send money without contacting the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General to confirm the other party’s situation. You can also call our Office of Overseas Citizens Services at 888-407-4747 (from overseas: 202-501-4444). Review our information on  emergency assistance to Americans abroad.\nU.S. citizens have had problems with business partners, usually involving property investments. You may wish to seek professional legal advice in reviewing any contracts for business or services offered in India. The U.S. Embassy and consulates cannot give legal advice. They also cannot help U.S. citizens with Indian courts on civil or criminal matters. A list of local attorneys is available on the Embassy and Consulates General  websites .\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for more information on scams.\nDon’t buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are the bootlegs illegal in the United States, if you purchase them you may also be breaking local law.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the local police, then inform the U.S. Embassy or local Consulate.\nReport crimes to the local police by calling “100” or “112” from a mobile phone.  \nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nYou should ask for a copy of the police report, known as a “First Information Report” (FIR), from local police when you report an incident. Local authorities generally can't act without a police report. \nIf your passport is stolen, report the theft or loss right away. Report it to the police in the place where your passport was stolen. You need an FIR to get an exit visa to leave India. The Indian government requires it if the lost passport had your Indian visa. Although the Embassy or Consulate General is able to replace a stolen or lost passport, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) are responsible for approving an exit permit. This process usually takes three to four working days but can take longer.\nIn cases of sexual assault or rape, the Embassy or Consulates General can provide a list of local doctors and hospitals, if needed, to discuss treatment and prevention options for diseases and pregnancy. You should be aware that for evidence of an assault to be submitted in a court case, Indian authorities require that the medical exam be completed at a government hospital. Therefore, if a victim goes to a private hospital for treatment, the hospital will refer them to a government hospital for this aspect of the medical process. \nIndia has many resources for victims of rape and sexual assault. The specific toll-free Women’s Helpline Service number in Delhi is 1091; in Mumbai it is 103; in Kolkata, 1090; in Chennai, 1091 or 2345-2365; and in Hyderabad 1098.\nThe local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in India is “100.” An additional emergency number, “112,” can be accessed from mobile phones.\nPlease see our  information for victims of crime , including possible victim compensation programs in the United States. \nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulates for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. You may face arrest, imprisonment, and/or deportation if you violate local laws, even unknowingly.  \nFurthermore, some activities are crimes under U.S. law and can be prosecuted in the U.S. regardless of whether they are allowed under local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice website.\nIf police or prison officials arrest or detain you, immediately ask them to notify the U.S. Embassy. See our  webpage  for further information.\nAlcohol:  Each of India’s states has its own rules for buying and drinking alcohol. Legal drinking ages range from 18 to 25 and can vary by beverage type. Some states permit alcohol use for medicinal purposes only while others require you to hold a permit to buy, transport, or consume alcohol. Penalties for violation can be harsh.\nSeveral U.S. citizens at Indian airports have been arrested for attempting to smuggle illegal drugs from India. Many claim that they did not realize they were carrying narcotics. Never transport or mail packages that do not belong to you and maintain direct control of your luggage at all times.\nBeef and Cow Hide:  Several states in India impose various types of prohibition on beef. In some rural areas, cow protection vigilantes have attacked people they suspected of selling or consuming beef, or possessing items made with cow hide.\nSPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:\nDual Nationality:  India does not permit its citizens to hold dual nationality. In 2006, India launched the \"Overseas Citizens of India\" (OCI) program, which does not grant Indian citizenship but is similar to a U.S. \"green card\" in that you can travel to and from India indefinitely, work in India, study in India, and own property in India (except for certain agricultural and plantation properties). If you are a U.S. citizen and obtain an OCI card you will not become a citizen of India; you will remain a citizen of the United States. An OCI card holder does not receive an Indian passport, cannot vote in Indian elections, and is not eligible for Indian government employment.\nU.S. citizens of Indian descent can apply for OCI cards at the Indian Embassy in Washington or at the Indian Consulates in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Houston. Inside India, U.S. citizens can apply at the nearest FRRO office (please see “Entry/Exit Requirements” section above for more information on the FRRO). U.S. citizens must use a U.S. passport when traveling in and out of the United States.\nFaith-based travelers and those participating in religious activities should refer to the Department of State's Report on International Religious Freedom. Indian law mandates that individuals engaging in religious proselytizing obtain a \"missionary\" visa. Immigration authorities have determined that engaging in certain activities, such as speaking at religious meetings open to the general public, could violate immigration law if the traveler does not possess a missionary visa. Foreigners with tourist visas who engage in missionary activity are subject to deportation and possible criminal prosecution. The states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Arunachal Pradesh have legislation that regulates or places restrictions on conversion from one religion to another. If you plan to engage in missionary activity, you may want to seek legal advice to find out if Indian law permits the activities you plan to pursue.\nTourists should also mind restrictions and observances when planning to visit any religious establishment. These include Hindu temples, mosques, churches, and other sacred places to the local population. Many individual temples and mosques do not permit non-members to enter all or parts of the facilities, and may require the removal of shoes, the covering of the head, or have other specific requirements for appropriate attire.  \nCustoms rules are strict. Before traveling to or from India, inspect all bags and clothes well. Make sure they do not contain banned items. Airport security officials have arrested or detained several U.S. citizens after discovering loose ammunition (including spent individual bullets and casings) or weapons in their luggage. If authorities find loose ammunition or bullets (including empty bullet shells used in souvenirs) on your person or in your bags, they will charge you with violating the Indian Arms Act, and may incarcerate or deport you from India.\nHaving a satellite phone or Global Positioning System (GPS) device in India is  illegal  and can result in fines, detention, or arrest. Penalties can be as high as $200,000 and lead to up to three years in jail\nIndian customs authorities enforce strict regulations. They cover temporary importation into or export from India of items like antiquities, electronics, currency, ivory, gold objects, and other banned materials. You need permission from the Government of India to bring in restricted items, even if you are only transiting through India. If you do not comply with these regulations, you risk arrest or fine or both and confiscation of these items. If Indian law enforcement charges you with any legal violations, make sure to have an attorney review any document before signing it. The Government of India requires the registration of antique items with the local police along with a photograph of the item. It is advisable to contact the Embassy of India in Washington or one of India's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements. More information is available from the  Indian Central Board of Excise and Customs.   \nIndian customs authorities encourage the use of an ATA (Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission) Carnet for the temporary admission of professional equipment, commercial samples, and/or goods for exhibitions and fair purposes. ATA Carnet Headquarters, located at the  U.S. Council for International Business , 1212 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, issues and guarantees the ATA Carnet in the United States. For additional information call (212) 354-4480, or  email USCIB  for details. Please see our section on  Customs Information  for more information.\nNatural Disaster Threats:  Parts of northern India are highly susceptible to earthquakes. Regions of highest risk, ranked 5 on a scale of 1 to 5, include areas around Srinagar, Himachal Pradesh, Rishikesh and Dehradun, the northern parts of Punjab, northwest Gujarat, northern Bihar, and the entire northeast. Ranked 4 (high damage risk) is an area that sweeps along the north through Jammu and Kashmir, Eastern Punjab, Haryana, Northern Uttar Pradesh, central Bihar and the northern parts of West Bengal. New Delhi is located in zone 4. Severe flooding is common in hilly and mountainous areas throughout India. Flooding in 2013 in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and other areas left thousands of people presumed dead and temporarily stranded dozens of U.S. citizens.\nTyphoons/cyclones and subsequent flooding are common along the Indian coasts, in particular the Eastern coastal states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal, and have at times resulted in massive loss of life. Tourists and residents in areas prone to these events should remain vigilant during severe weather, monitor local media for latest developments, and heed all municipal warnings. Residents in these areas should have contingency plans for loss of power and unavailability of goods and services, including supplies for multiple days after a severe weather event.\nAccessibility:  Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation in India very different than what you find in the United States. Despite legislation that all public buildings and transport be accessible for disabled people, accessibility remains limited. One notable exception is the Delhi metro system, designed to be accessible to those with physical disabilities.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips.\nLGB Travelers: The Supreme Court of India decriminalized same-sex relationships in 2018. Since then, state and union governments have been directed to develop reforms that protect the rights of LGB persons.\nAlthough Indian law prohibits discrimination by state and nonstate actors based on sexual orientation, the government is inconsistent in implementing and enforcing these laws, and reports of widespread discrimination, harassment, threats, and violence against LGB persons, particularly in rural areas or by local police, persist.\nSee our LGB Travel Information page and section 6 of our  Human Rights  report for further details.\nFor emergency services in India, dial 112 from a cell phone; from a land line, dial 100 for police, 102 for ambulance (108 in parts of South India), and 101 for fire.\nAmbulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, and traffic does not yield to emergency vehicles. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. Most hospitals require advance payment or confirmation of insurance prior to treatment. Payment practices vary, and credit cards are not routinely accepted for medical care.\nZika, dengue, malaria, measles, and other diseases are present in India. See the  Center for Disease Control’s website  for more information.\nThe quality of medical care in India varies considerably. Medical care in the major population centers approaches and occasionally meets Western standards, but adequate medical care is usually very limited or unavailable in rural areas.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. \nMake sure your health insurance covers care overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.We strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of India to ensure the medication is legal in India. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. \nPharmaceuticals:  Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with limited controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. When buying medication, consult with a medical professional and purchase from reputable establishments. Please visit the  U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention website on counterfeit drugs  for more information.\nWater Quality:  Water is a common vehicle for the transmission of disease. Impure drinking water can transmit serious diseases such as typhoid, cholera, hepatitis, and dysentery. You can make water safe for drinking by filtering/boiling, distilling, or using chemicals. Bottled water is generally safe for consumption. It is best to stick to the major brands. The water bottle seal or cap should be intact.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIf you are arriving in India from Sub-Saharan Africa or other areas with yellow-fever risk, Indian health regulations require that you present evidence of vaccination against yellow fever. If you lack such proof, authorities may immediately deport you or detain you in the yellow-fever quarantine center for six days. If you travel through any part of sub-Saharan Africa, even for one day, health authorities advise you to carry proof of yellow fever immunization.\nDogs and bats create a high risk of rabies transmission in most of India. Health authorities recommend vaccination for all prolonged stays, especially for young children and travelers in rural areas. It is also recommended for shorter stays that involve occupational exposure, locations more than 24 hours from a reliable source of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine for post-exposure treatment, adventure travelers, hikers, cave explorers, and backpackers. Monkeys also can transmit rabies and herpes B, among other diseases, to human victims. Avoid feeding monkeys. If bitten, you should immediately soak and scrub the bite for at least 15 minutes and seek urgent medical attention.\nInfluenza transmission occurs from November to April in areas north of the Tropic of Cancer (north India) and from June through November (the rainy season) in areas south of the Tropic of Cancer (south India), with a smaller peak from February through April; off-season transmission can also occur. All travelers are at risk. During the flu season, health authorities recommend that all travelers get the influenza vaccine.\nOutbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1 virus) occur intermittently in eastern India, including West Bengal, Manipur, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Assam.\nMalaria risk depends on time of year and area the traveler is visiting. Please consult the  CDC website for India  for more information. Dengue fever presents significant risk in urban and rural areas. Health officials report the highest number of cases from July to December, with cases peaking from September to October. The CDC recommends taking daytime insect precautions, such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and mosquito repellent.\nTuberculosis is an increasingly serious health concern in India. Please visit the  CDC website   or more information.\nFurther health information:\nAir pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in India, and you should consult your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. The air quality in India varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the winter. Anyone who travels where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: \nCurrent air quality data can be found on the  Department of State’s air quality page . The data on this site are updated hourly. \nRh-negative blood may be difficult to obtain as it is not common in Asia. \nMedical Tourism:  Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. Companies offering vacation packages bundled with medical consultations and financing options provide direct-to-consumer advertising over the internet. Such medical packages often claim to provide high quality care, but the quality of health care in India is highly variable. People seeking health care in India should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations.  \nAnyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and  refer to the information from the CDC . Persons traveling to India for medical purposes require the proper “medical” visa. Please check with the nearest Indian embassy or consulate for more information. \nDespite reports of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in hospitals, in general travelers should not delay or avoid treatment for urgent or emergent medical situations. However, health tourists and other travelers who may be contemplating elective procedures in this country should carefully research individual hospital infection control practices. \nSurrogacy:  Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in India, subject to complex local regulation. For additional information,  visit the Government of India’s official information on foreigner surrogacy .  \nThe U.S. Embassy and Consulates General in India maintain lists of local doctors and hospitals, all of which are published on their respective websites under \"U.S. Citizen Services.\" We cannot endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Travel by road in India is dangerous. India leads the world in traffic-related deaths and a number of U.S. citizens have suffered fatal traffic accidents in recent years. You should exercise extreme caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas, and try to use only cars that have seatbelts. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) and in back seats of taxis and rideshare vehicles. Helmets should always be worn on motorcycles and bicycles. Travel at night is particularly hazardous. \nOn Indian roads, the safest driving policy is always to assume that other drivers will not respond to a traffic situation in the same way you would in the United States, including the use of driving lanes. Buses and trucks often run red lights and merge directly into traffic at yield points and traffic circles. Cars, autos, bicycles, and pedestrians behave only slightly more cautiously. Use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence. It is both customary and wise. \nInside and outside major cities, roads are often poorly maintained and congested. Even main roads frequently have only two lanes, with poor visibility and inadequate warning markers. On the few divided highways one can expect to meet local transportation traveling in the wrong direction, often without lights. Heavy traffic is the norm and includes (but is not limited to) overloaded trucks and buses, scooters, pedestrians, bullock and camel carts, horse or elephant riders en route to weddings, bicycles, and free-roaming livestock. \nPublic Transportation:  Buses, patronized by hundreds of millions of Indians, are convenient in that they serve almost every city of any size. However, in some areas, they are often driven fast, recklessly, and without consideration for the rules of the road. Accidents are common. \nTraffic Laws:  Traffic in India moves on the left. It is important to be alert while crossing streets and intersections, especially after dark as traffic is coming in the \"wrong\" direction. Travelers should remember to use seatbelts in both rear and front seats where available, and to ask their drivers to maintain a safe speed. \nIn order to drive in India, you must have either a valid Indian driver’s license or a valid international driver’s license. Because of difficult road and traffic conditions, you may wish to consider hiring a local driver. Your U.S. driver’s license will not work. \nIf a driver hits a pedestrian or a cow, the vehicle and its occupants are at risk of being attacked by passersby. Such attacks pose significant risk of injury or death to the vehicle's occupants or risk of incineration of the vehicle. It could be unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident of this nature, and drivers may instead wish to seek out the nearest police station.   \n   \nProtestors often use road blockage as a means of publicizing their grievances, causing severe inconvenience to travelers. Visitors should monitor local news reports for any reports of road disturbances. \nPlease refer to our  Road Safety  page for more information. \nEmergency Numbers:  The following emergency numbers work in New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata: \nAVIATION SAFETY OVERSIGHT:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of India’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of India’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s Safety Management page . Travelers are urged to use caution while booking private helicopters for travel, especially in the northeast."

The Government of Indonesia will not admit travelers holding the 12-page U.S. emergency passport, issued by U.S. embassies and consulates overseas.\nVisa-on-Arrival:   If you meet the requirements, you can apply for a visa on arrival at some international airports, seaports, or land crossings. To apply for the visa on arrival, you must have an ordinary (non-emergency) passport with at least 6 months of validity from the date you plan to enter and the date you plan to leave Indonesia and a return or onward flight booking to another country. There is a 500,000 Indonesian Rupiah fee (about $35). The visa on arrival is valid for up to 30 days. You may extend a Visa-on-Arrival once at the immigration office one week before it expires for an additional 30 days for a maximum of 30 additional days, for another 500,000 Rupiah.\nElectronic Visa-On-Arrival:  You may also apply for an electronic Visa on Arrival (e-VOA) in advance if you are entering Indonesia at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta or Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali. Check the e-VOA requirements from Indonesian Immigration before applying. To apply for an e-VOA see  https://molina.imigrasi.go.id/ .\nVisa:  Travel for more than 30 days and travel for non-VOA purposes, including employment and journalism, requires that the appropriate visa be obtained from an Indonesian embassy or consulate before arrival. If you are traveling on an emergency passport, you must obtain a visa before arrival in Indonesia.\nIf you overstay your visa, you are subject to a fine of 1 million Indonesian rupiah (about $70 USD at current exchange rates; fees may change at any time) per day and may be detained and deported.  U.S. citizens have been jailed for visa overstays or entering the country on the wrong visa class for their purpose of travel . Travelers coming to Indonesia for non-tourism purposes are strongly encouraged to consult Indonesian Immigration’s website. Travelers should generally carry a copy of their passport with them whenever possible to establish their identity and proof of Indonesian visa.\nYou must exit Indonesia using the same passport that you used to enter.  If this passport is replaced for any reason before you depart Indonesia, you must apply with Immigration to obtain a “special pass” (exit permit) in your new passport prior to departing.\nDual-Nationality:   Indonesia has laws that prohibit Indonesian citizens from holding additional nationalities. If you are an Indonesian with dual nationality, you could be compelled to renounce your Indonesian nationality through a formal act of renunciation. Please research Indonesian nationality laws and consult with a local attorney regarding any specific circumstance.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Indonesia. The Government of Indonesia screens incoming passengers in response to reported outbreaks of pandemic illnesses.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nExtremists in Indonesia aspire to carry out violent attacks against Indonesian and foreign targets, and police have arrested more than 1,200 individuals on terrorism-related charges since 2018. Extremists may target both official and private establishments, including government offices, hotels, bars, nightclubs, shopping areas, restaurants, and places of worship. Be aware of your personal safety and security at all times.\nRecent incidents of extremist violence include a December 2022 suicide bombing at a police station in Bandung, West Java that killed one police officer, a March 2021 bomb attack against a church in Makassar, South Sulawesi which injured 20 civilians, and May 2018 bomb attacks against three churches in Surabaya, East Java which killed 15 civilians and injured 50.\nDemonstrations are very common in Jakarta, Surabaya, and other large cities, but less common in Bali. You should avoid demonstrations and other mass gatherings, since even those intended to be peaceful can become violent. U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests.  Demonstrations may become more frequent ahead of the Indonesian general elections scheduled for February 2024.\nCurrently, travel by U.S. government personnel to the provinces of Central Papua (Papua Tengah) and Highland Papua (Papua Pegunungan) is restricted to mission-essential travel that is approved in advance by the Embassy. Papuan separatists have kidnapped foreigners in the past and a New Zealand national was kidnapped by a separatist group in Nduga Regency in February 2023.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:   In the last year several American citizens were victims of violent and serious crimes in Indonesia, particularly in Bali. As with any major tourist destination, U.S. citizens traveling in Indonesia are especially encouraged to always remain vigilant of their surroundings and read the following advisories carefully. Take sensible measures to protect yourself and your belongings.  Closely monitor bags and luggage and carry only essential items. Take particular care of your passport and bank cards and avoid traveling alone.\nPolice presence and responsiveness is less than it is in the United States, making it more difficult to report crimes quickly and receive police attention. U.S. citizens often cite language barriers as a major hindrance when reporting crimes.\nPickpocketing, sexual assault, vehicle theft, armed car-jacking, snatch and grab robberies of cell phones and purses, and residential break-ins are common. Avoid traveling to isolated areas late at night. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly vehicles or individuals that might be following you.\nUse a reputable taxi company or hire a taxi either at a major hotel or shopping center and ensure the driver’s identity card is visible. If you are booking a car via a mobile app, always ensure that the driver is the same as the person on the app, share your journey with a friend via the in-app option, and know the contact information for the app’s security center. Be aware of drivers falsely claiming to be registered with online ride hailing apps.\nCredit card fraud is a common problem in Indonesia. Criminals have “skimmed” credit/debit cards to access and drain bank accounts. Use an ATM in a secure location, such as a major bank branch, and check the machine for evidence of tampering. Monitor your account statements regularly.\nTourists and Indonesians have suffered from serious illness and have even died from \"drink-spiking” and drink poisoning incidents, particularly in clubs and nightspots in urban and tourist areas. There have been reports of sexual assaults and drink spiking in Bali, Lombok, and the Gili Islands.  Make sure drinks are prepared in your sight and be careful about accepting drinks from strangers at clubs and parties or leaving drinks unattended. Tourists have also been robbed after taking visitors to their hotel rooms, and in some cases have found that their drinks were spiked. There have also been deaths and serious illnesses caused by drinking alcoholic drinks contaminated with methanol. These cases have occurred in bars, shops, and hotels in popular tourist areas like Bali, Lombok, the Gili Islands, and Sumatra.\nSexual Assault:  Women travelling alone may be subject to harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment, and rape occur. To minimize the risk, avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General.  \nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams occur in Indonesia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:\nVictims of Crime:\nSexual assault:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek prompt medical assistance, contact the Embassy or nearest Consulate, and call the local police at 112. For a criminal investigation to be initiated by the police, the victim must make a full statement to the local police, in person.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault may choose to be accompanied by a translator.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism and recreational activity industries are unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  Water sports, especially diving, can be hazardous in Indonesia with operators lightly regulated and hyperbaric chambers available only in Bali and Ambon.  Traffic is hazardous in Indonesia and U.S. citizens are frequently injured while riding rented motorbikes. Wearing a helmet is required by law. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities, and only basic stabilization may be available. Serious injuries require medical evacuation to another country. First responders are generally unable to provide urgent medical treatment or to access areas outside of major cities. Boat and ferry incidents are frequent; vessels rarely carry appropriate sizes and numbers of safety vests; passengers are encouraged to bring their own. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage  ( http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/health/insurance-providers.html ).\nPlease note:   The U.S. Embassy and Consulates do not pay the medical expenses of private U.S. citizens in Indonesia. It is the traveler’s responsibility to ensure adequate medical insurance coverage or funds for medical expenses.\nCriminal Penalties:   You are subject to Indonesian laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Criminal cases can take months or even years to resolve, and suspects can be held without charges for up to 60 days, and in many cases longer. Indonesia‘s revised criminal code, which takes effect January 2026, includes penalties for defamation, blasphemy, cohabitation, and sex outside of marriage. Enroll in the  Smart Traveler Enrollment Program  (STEP) to stay up-to-date.\nIf you are convicted of possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Indonesia, you may be subject to heavy fines, long jail sentences, and even the death penalty. Some prescription medications that are available in the United States are illegal in Indonesia. Some drugs used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are illegal in Indonesia. Marijuana, Cannabis, hash, “edibles,” and products containing CBD or THC remain illegal in Indonesia, including for medicinal purposes. A medical prescription does not make it legal. If you take such products to Indonesia or purchase or use them in Indonesia, you can be arrested and face imprisonment, fines, deportation, or the death penalty. Illegal drug convictions often result in lengthy prison sentences, even at the simple possession level. Indonesian prison conditions are harsh and do not meet U.S. standards. Many prisons are overcrowded and provide minimal services. The costs of basic services, including healthcare, often must be borne by the prisoner.\nIndividuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:   LGB status or conduct is not illegal, but local authorities sometimes take legal action against, or tolerate harassment of people engaging in LGB relationships or openly expressing LGB identity. Some local governments have passed laws criminalizing LGB relationships. Same-sex marriages or civil unions recognized as valid in other countries are not legally recognized in Indonesia. The Indonesian Parliament revised the criminal code to include penalties for cohabitation and sex outside of marriage. These revisions, however, will not come into force until January 2026, and how they will be implemented is unclear.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report for further details .\nSharia Law:   Sharia law is enforced in Aceh province and may exist unofficially or through local legislation in other areas. The law is intended for Muslims and should not apply to non-Muslims or foreign visitors. You should be respectful of local traditions, mindful of social norms, and seek guidance from local police if confronted by Sharia authorities. \nEarthquakes and Tsunamis:  There are approximately 4,000 earthquakes per year in Indonesia, or more than 10 per day on average. While most earthquakes are mild, some cause significant destruction and can trigger tsunamis. Tsunami warning systems may not be operable, or reports of tremors and tsunamis may be delayed. Local construction standards are lower than in the United States, and many structures including hotels and malls are prone to damage or collapse in an earthquake. Access to disaster-affected areas is often difficult and assistance from the U.S. Embassy may be limited.\nIf a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, you should follow the instructions of local authorities, bearing in mind that a tsunami could arrive within minutes. The  Indonesia Tsunami Early Warning Centre  issues tsunami warnings when a potential tsunami with significant impact is imminent or expected.\nVolcanoes:   There are 127 active volcanoes in Indonesia. Eruptions frequently cause travel delays, displace local populations, and disrupt economic activities. \nEnvironmental Quality:   Air quality in Indonesia’s major cities can range from \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" to \"unhealthy.\" Current air quality data for Jakarta can be found on the Embassy’s  Air Quality  page. Tap water is not potable throughout Indonesia and should not be consumed. \nMountain Hiking:  When hiking in mountainous areas, obtain current information on local conditions, travel with a reputable guide, have overseas medical insurance, and carry a local mobile phone. Never go hiking or climbing alone. Particularly dangerous trails may not be clearly labeled as such. Hikers on Puncak Jaya in Papua should have realistic primary and backup plans for climbing down the mountain. Tour operators have abandoned climbers. Taking shortcuts through private property is considered trespassing and is not a safe or legal alternative to a proper plan. If possible, ensure your hiking plans are registered and known to local authorities and/or tourism operators, as this helps identify your presence in these areas in the event of an emergency. \nDual Nationality:   Indonesian law does not recognize dual nationality for adults over 18 years of age. U.S. citizens who are also Indonesian nationals may be required to renounce their Indonesian citizenship and may also be deported.  Please visit our Dual Nationality page .\nTravelers with Disabilities:  Persons with disabilities will face severe difficulties in Indonesia as most public places and transportation facilities do not accommodate disabled people. The law in Indonesia prohibits discrimination against persons with mental and physical disabilities, but the law is seldom enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be extremely limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:   Women traveling alone may be subject to harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment, and rape occur. To minimize the risk, avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. While domestic violence is illegal in Indonesia, these laws are rarely enforced. Local authorities may not respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. If you are the victim of a sexual assault, you should report it immediately to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate General and seek medical attention. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nThe Government of Indonesia requires all non-Indonesian citizens entering the country to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. \nMedical Care:  For emergency services in Indonesia dial 112.\nSanitation and health care conditions in Indonesia are far below U.S. standards. Routine medical care is available in all major cities, although most expatriates leave the country for all but the most basic medical procedures. Physicians and hospitals often expect payment or sizable deposits before providing medical care, even in emergency and/or life-threatening situations. See our  Embassy's  website for a list of English-speaking doctors and hospitals, but keep in mind that even in large cities the quality of English-speaking medical personnel will vary and there are often communication difficulties. In remote areas there may be no English-speaking medical personnel. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.\nAmbulance services are not widely available, and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:   Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, which can exceed over $100,000 per person.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Be aware that Indonesian authorities may consider some prescription drugs as illegal narcotics. The Indonesian government does not publish a list of which pharmaceuticals are considered contraband, and these decisions may be arbitrary.\nU.S. citizens are advised against mailing or shipping by courier any medications to Indonesia. Indonesian authorities pay close attention to packages containing pharmaceuticals and may detain or arrest recipients of both prescription and over the counter medications. Even if a medication is legal or has been prescribed in the United States, it may be considered an illegal narcotic in Indonesia. U.S. citizens are advised to only hand carry prescription medications into the country, in the original packaging with a copy of any prescription. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates cannot assist you with the importation and/or release of medications.  \nMarijuana, Cannabis, hash, “edibles,” and products containing CBD or THC remain illegal in Indonesia, including for medicinal purposes.  A medical prescription does not make it legal.\nLocal pharmacies carry a range of products of variable quality, availability, and cost. Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a significant risk; patronize only reputable pharmacies. Malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and  Zika virus  are mosquito borne diseases in Indonesia.  Prevention of mosquito bites  is strongly encouraged; malaria preventive medication is needed in some areas. Pregnant women should be aware that Indonesia is a  CDC Zika risk area  and that Zika can be spread by mosquitos as well as  sexual contact . Diarrheal diseases are very common throughout Indonesia and  food and water precautions  are recommended. Rabies is prevalent in animals and animal contact should be avoided.\nVaccinations:   Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:   Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.  See the OPTIONAL stock language below for additional suggestions.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\nPharmaceuticals\nWater Quality\nAdventure Travel\nGeneral Health Language\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nAir Quality\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic in Indonesia is hazardous, congested, and undisciplined. Traffic signals are frequently ignored and often in disrepair. Motor vehicles share the roads with other forms of transportation such as pedicabs and pushcarts. Buses and trucks are often dangerously overloaded and travel at high speeds. Accidents between a car and a motorcycle are viewed as the fault of the driver of the car. Consider these risks before driving your own vehicle, especially if you are unaccustomed to Indonesian road conditions.  When an accident results in personal injury, Indonesian law requires both drivers to await the arrival of a police officer to report the accident.\nPublic Transportation:    Air, ferry, and road accidents that result in fatalities, injuries, and significant damage are common. While all forms of transportation are regulated in Indonesia, oversight is spotty, maintenance may not be properly performed, and rescue and emergency capacity are limited. Indonesia has experienced several fatal plane crashes and non-fatal runway overruns in recent years. Also in recent years, several ferry accidents and a train collision resulted in dozens of fatalities and even more injuries because of over-crowding and unsafe conditions.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Also, visit  Indonesia's national tourist office  online for road safety information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Indonesia’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Indonesia’s air carrier operations.  Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nSince 2014, several private pilots have inadvertently crossed into Indonesian airspace and have been detained and paid heavy fines. If you intend to fly on private aircraft through Indonesian airspace, get clearances from Indonesian aviation authorities before you depart. \nMaritime Safety and Security:   Inter-island travel by boat or ferry can be dangerous: storms can appear quickly, vessels may be over-crowded and lack basic safety equipment, and safety standards vary. Ferries have sunk, resulting in loss of life. The Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency records boat and ferry accidents resulting in injuries and deaths yearly. Boats and ferries used in tourism or general transportation frequently break down, stranding passengers or capsizing; not all boats are equipped with adequate life vests. Make sure you are satisfied with safety equipment and life jackets before travelling. \nPiracy:   Maritime piracy and other related crimes in and around Indonesian waters continue. Recent reports include thefts of valuables or cargo from boats that are in port and out at sea. Before traveling by sea, especially in the Strait of Malacca between Riau Province and Singapore, and in the waters north of Sulawesi and Kalimantan, review the current security situation with local authorities. Be vigilant, reduce opportunities for theft, establish secure areas on board, and report all incidents to the coastal and flag state authorities.\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Indonesia should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts on the  Maritime Administration website . Information may also be posted to the websites of the  U.S. Coast Guard  and the  National Geospace Intelligence Agency  (select “broadcast warnings”).\nIn recent years, private vessels have inadvertently anchored in Indonesian waters, especially near Singapore, and have been detained and paid heavy fines."

The Foreign Interests Section provides limited consular services to U.S. citizens in Tehran including:\nSee the Department of State’s  Fact Sheet on Iran  for information on U.S.-Iran relations.\nBefore traveling to Iran, please consider the current  Travel Advisory .\nThe Travel Advisory for Iran is Level 4, Do Not Travel. The Department of State recommends U.S. citizens do not travel to Iran due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens. Exercise increased caution due to wrongful detentions. \nIranian authorities continue to wrongfully detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly U.S.-Iranian dual nationals, on charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities have also prevented the departure of U.S. citizens from Iran. U.S. citizens of Iranian origin should consider the risk of being targeted by authorities before planning travel to Iran. Iranian authorities routinely deny dual nationals access to the Foreign Interests Section of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran because they consider dual nationals to be solely Iranian citizens.\nU.S. passports are valid for travel to Iran. However, U.S.-Iranian dual nationals must enter and exit Iran on Iranian passports. As indicated above, the Iranian government does not recognize  dual nationality  and will treat U.S.-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens. Iranian authorities may consider some U.S. citizens – even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves to be Iranian – to be Iranian nationals.  \nU.S. government employees, including contractors, are strictly prohibited from traveling to Iran without prior authorization from the Department of State.\nU.S.-Iranian dual nationals should obtain, in their Iranian passports, the necessary visas for the countries they will transit on their return trip to the United States so that if the U.S. passports are confiscated in Iran, they may depart Iran with their Iranian passports. These individuals can then apply for new U.S. passports in the country they are transiting.  \nU.S. citizens residing in Iran on permanent resident visas must obtain an exit permit each time they depart Iran, regardless of the period of stay. All Iranian passport holders are required to pay an exit tax. More specific information on Iranian passport and exit permit requirements may be obtained from the  Iranian Interests Section of the Embassy of Pakistan  in Washington, D.C.\nThe Iranian civil code states that women who marry Iranian men acquire Iranian nationality. If the marriage takes place in Iran, the woman’s U.S. passport may be confiscated by Iranian authorities. A woman must have the consent of her husband to leave Iran or, in his absence, consent from another suitable authority. The Foreign Interests Section of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran can provide only limited assistance if a U.S. citizen woman married to an Iranian man encounters difficulty in leaving Iran. In addition, if marriage to an Iranian citizen is not officially recognized by the Iranian government, the couple will be committing the crime of adultery if they travel together, the maximum penalty for which is death.\nPlease contact the Swiss Embassy or appropriate Iranian authorities for special circumstances cases involving divorce and custody rights in Iran.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Iran. If you intend to reside in Iran, you must submit to a blood test, which may include an HIV test, in order to apply for a residency permit. Permits will be refused if the HIV test is positive.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nAs noted in the  Travel Advisory  for Iran, U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Iran face a significant threat of kidnapping or arrest and detention on spurious charges.\nU.S. citizens who travel to Iran despite the Travel Advisory should exercise caution throughout the country, but especially in the southeastern region where foreigners have been victims of criminal gangs. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to areas within 100 kilometers of the border with Afghanistan, near the Iraq border, and generally anywhere east of the line from Bam and Bandar Abbas toward the Pakistani border.\nTerrorism:  In Iran, there is potential for death or injury because of terrorist attacks. Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for bombings and other attacks in Iran. The threat of terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Additionally, Iran is a designated state-sponsor of terrorism.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:  Foreigners occasionally become victims of petty street crime, including robberies and bag-snatchings, in Iran. There have been reports of robberies by police impersonators, usually in civilian clothing. Insist on seeing the officer’s identity card and request the presence of a uniformed officer/marked patrol car. Travelers should take the following precautions:\nDemonstrations  occur sporadically. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Past demonstrations have turned violent.\nIranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, computers, fax machines, and other electronics may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. The Iranian authorities may also confiscate cell phones, computers, and other devices. U.S. citizens should consider not taking electronic devices to Iran or deleting personal information from them beforehand.\nDisaster Preparedness:  Iran is prone to earthquakes, many of them severe. To learn more about the seismic regions of Iran, including the most recent earthquakes, please visit the  U.S. Geological Survey website .\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:\nReport crimes to the local police by dialing 110 and contact the Embassy of Switzerland’s Foreign Interests Section at (98) (21) 2254-2178. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nThe local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Iran is: 115 for ambulance service, 125 for fire, and 110 for police. English speakers, however, are generally unavailable.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nThe Department of State, through the Embassy of Switzerland’s Foreign Interests Section, can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy of Switzerland’s Foreign Interests Section for assistance. U.S. citizens should note that the Foreign Interests Section may be able to provide limited assistance only and that Iranian law does not prohibit domestic violence.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Long prison terms and solitary confinement are common as are punishments including execution, amputation, flogging, blinding, stoning, and fines. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nExamples of local laws that you may be unfamiliar with include:\nCarry a copy of your U.S. passport (biodata page and page with Iranian visa) and some other form of identification with you at all times so that, if questioned by local officials, proof of U.S. citizenship is readily available.\nIf you are arrested while in Iran, request that the police and prison officials notify the Foreign Interests Section at the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran immediately to ensure that the United States is aware of your circumstances. Under Iranian law, detainees may also request legal representation, although the authorities sometimes fail to allow timely access to attorneys. \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nIran-U.S. Claims Tribunal:  The Iranian government reportedly has the names of all individuals who filed claims against Iran at the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal at The Hague pursuant to the 1981 Algerian Accords. In addition, the Iranian government reportedly has compiled a list of the claimants who were awarded compensation in the Iran Claims Program administered by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The Iranian government has allegedly been targeting award-holders who travel to Iran. Some former claimants have reported being questioned by Iranian authorities upon their entry into Iran as to the status of payment of their respective awards with a view to recouping the award money.

See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers : Same-sex relationships in Iran are criminalized and are punishable by death, flogging, or a lesser punishment. LGB individuals are often subject to violence and the law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or recognize LGB] individuals, couples, or families.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Iran prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced.

Iran is prone to significant droughts in the hot summer months. In cities outside of Tehran, water may be harder to obtain given the availability in those regions and larger water reserves servicing the capital. Tap water in Iran is relatively safe, however it is recommended to consume bottled water, which is regularly available. \nRoad Conditions and Safety:   While in Iran, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Travelers in possession of International Driver’s Permits may drive in Iran, though the Foreign Interests Section in Iran does not recommend that tourists do so. Iran has a very high rate of traffic accidents, the second highest cause of mortality in the country. Drivers throughout Iran tend to ignore traffic lights, traffic signs, and lane markers. Urban streets are not well lit; it is therefore particularly dangerous to drive at night. Sidewalks in urban areas exist only on main roads and are usually obstructed by parked cars. In residential areas, few sidewalks exist. Drivers almost never yield to pedestrians at crosswalks. If you are involved in an accident, no matter how minor, do not leave the scene; wait until the police arrive to file a report.\nTraffic Laws:  Iranian authorities sometimes set up informal roadblocks, both in cities and on highways, often manned by young, inexperienced officers who are suspicious of foreigners. Carry identification with you and avoid getting into disputes.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Iran, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Iran’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Due to a passport backlog, Israeli citizens are temporarily allowed to enter and depart Israel on non-Israeli passports until December 31, 2025. U.S.-Israeli citizens do not need to submit an  Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL)  application and should depart the United States on their U.S. passport and enter Israel on their Israeli passport as long as they have checked in to their flight with the Israeli passport.\nIsraeli citizens are prohibited from using the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge crossing. They are also prohibited from entering Gaza and are generally prohibited from traveling to parts of the West Bank under PA control (Area A), to include Bethlehem and Jericho.\nFurther information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction,  and  customs regulations  can be found on our website at travel.state.gov.\nTerrorism:   Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nPlease view the current  Travel Advisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza  for detailed information regarding the terrorism threat in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. For more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nPlease view the current  Travel Advisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza  for detailed information regarding the terrorism threat in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.\nMortar and Rocket Fire  or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion :  In the event of mortar or rocket fire  or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion , a “red alert” siren may be activated. Treat all such alerts as real. Follow the instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. Know the location of your closest shelter or protected space. U.S. government personnel and their family members may be restricted from traveling to areas affected by rocket activity, sirens, and/or the opening of bomb shelters. For additional information on appropriate action to take upon hearing a siren or explosion, see  the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command website  (available on devices within Israel) or view the  Preparedness Information.  U.S. citizens may also wish to download the free Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command application on  Android  or  Apple  devices to receive real-time security and safety alerts. Free commercial applications, such as Red Alert: Israel, are also available.\nCrime:  The crime rate is moderate in Israel and the West Bank. Parked vehicle break-ins are common at public beach areas, national parks, and other tourist sites. Vehicle theft also remains a problem. U.S. citizens should not leave their valuables (including passports) unattended in parked vehicles, on the beach, or unsecured in hotels. Visitors should be aware of their surroundings in tourist areas and watch for crimes of opportunity, such as pickpockets.  The crime rate in Gaza is now unknown given the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas.\nFor additional information, read the most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC)  Crime and Safety Report for Israel .\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nTechnology Usage Abroad : Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices include making sure all software (operating system and apps) are updated prior to traveling abroad and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible while abroad. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.\nGPS navigation applications (apps) can help you get around in a foreign country. Prior to using a GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without accounting for the safety of that route.\nBe cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police. The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Israel and the West Bank is 100 for police, 101 for an ambulance, and 102 for the fire department.\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv for assistance. You can reach U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv at the contact information provided above. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nProvide information on possible Government of Israel assistance to victims of crime:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should contact local police and/or the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (#118 from a local cell phone or via text at +972-50-227-0018) but may also contact U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv to report it.\nTourism:   The tourism industry is generally regulated in Israel and the West Bank. Rules with regards to general practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and trained staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to the local laws of the locations you visit or reside in. Foreign laws and legal systems can be significantly different from those of the United States. If you violate Israeli or Palestinian Authority (PA) laws, even unknowingly, being a U.S. citizen will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. The Israeli government will treat dual U.S-Israeli citizens as Israeli citizens, and the Palestinian Authority will treat dual U.S.-PA passport holders as PA \"citizens”– regardless of whether they entered Israel or PA-administered area on a U.S. passport.\nPenalties for possession, use, or trafficking illegal drugs in Israel and PA-administered areas are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Individuals expressing views, including on social media, which the Government of Israel considers incitement to violence or hate speech may face criminal penalties, even if the the substance and manner in which those views are expressed would be lawful in the United States. PA security officials have also arrested Palestinians who posted criticism of the PA and PA leadership online. In Gaza, individuals publicly criticizing authorities risk reprisal by Hamas, including arrest, interrogation, seizure of property, and harassment.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrests and Arrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Branch Office Tel Aviv immediately. See our  website on arrest or detention of a U.S. citizen abroad  for further information. While the U.S. Embassy may not recommend a particular foreign attorney, the embassy website has the  names of several attorneys  who have identified themselves as willing to assist U.S. citizen clients. Please note that inclusion on this list in no way represents an endorsement of services by the Department or the U.S. government. \nArrests and Arrest Notification by Israel: \nArrests and Arrest Notification by the Palestinian Authority (PA):\nGaza:  Since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, they have dominated security matters in Gaza, but this control has been degraded by Israel’s ongoing military operations against Hamas. The U.S. government is severely limited in what it can do to assist those detained in Gaza. In case of arrest or detention by Israeli security forces in Gaza, U.S. citizens should promptly identify themselves as such to the arresting authorities and should request that the U.S. Embassy be notified immediately.\nIsraeli Court Jurisdiction:  Military, civil and religious courts in Israel actively exercise their authority to bar certain individuals, including nonresidents, from leaving the country until debts or other legal claims and matters against them are resolved. Israel's religious courts exercise jurisdiction over all citizens and residents of Israel in cases of marriage, divorce, child custody, and child support. U.S. citizens, including those without Israeli citizenship, may be subject to involuntary and prolonged stays (and even imprisonment) in Israel if a case is filed against them in a religious court, even if their marriage took place in the United States, and regardless of whether their spouse is present in Israel. The U.S. Embassy is unable to cancel the debt of a U.S. citizen or guarantee their departure from Israel when they face a bar from leaving the country until debts are resolved.  \n  \n Purchases of Property:  U.S. citizens should always seek legal advice before buying or leasing property in the West Bank and Gaza. Please see the most recent  Investment Climate Statement for the West Bank and Gaza  for additional information on property rights.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods also may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.   See the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website   and  U.S. Department of Justice  website for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nInternational Volunteers:\nLGB Rights:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Israel. Israeli anti-discrimination laws protect LGB individuals. Acceptance and tolerance of LGB people vary throughout the country and from neighborhood to neighborhood. As of August 2014, the Law of Return allows that same-sex spouses of Jews immigrating to Israel – known as “making Aliyah” – are eligible to make Aliyah with their spouses and receive Israeli citizenship. \nThe legal systems in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are based on the 1960 Jordanian penal code which prohibits consensual same-sex sexual activity. However, the PA has not prosecuted individuals suspected of such activity. Societal discrimination, including from families, based on cultural and religious traditions is commonplace, making the West Bank and Gaza challenging environments for LGB persons. PA security officers have harassed, abused, and sometimes arrested LGB individuals because of their sexual orientation. NGOs have reported that Hamas also harassed and detained persons in Gaza due to their sexual orientation.  \nSee   our  LGB Travel Information page  and section 6 of the  Department of State's Human Rights report  for further details.\nPersons with Mobility Issues:  Individuals with mobility issues may find accessibility and accommodation in Israel very different from in the United States. Legislation mandates access to buildings and transportation, as well as accommodations for persons with disabilities in services and the workplace. However, the government enforces the laws with only limited success. Societal discrimination and lack of accessibility persist in employment and housing. The law mandates accessibility to urban public transportation but not to intercity buses. Most train stations maintain access for persons with disabilities; however, many buses still do not have such access. Television stations include subtitles or sign language, and the courts accommodate testimony from persons with intellectual disabilities or mental illness. Tourists will find restaurants, foot paths, and public transportation less accessible than in the United States.\nPA law prohibits discrimination based on disability. The Palestinian Disability Law was ratified in 1999, but implementation has been slow. It does not mandate access to buildings, information, or communications. Palestinians with disabilities continue to receive uneven and poor-quality services and care. Familial and societal discrimination against persons with disabilities exists in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in Israel, dial 101 for ambulances, and 100 for police.\nModern medical care and medicines are available in Israel. Some hospitals in Israel, most hospitals in the West Bank, and all hospitals in Gaza, however, fall below Western standards. Travelers can find information in English about emergency medical facilities and after-hours pharmacies in the  Jerusalem Post  and the English-language edition of the  Ha'aretz  newspaper, or refer to the  U.S. Embassy’s medical information list .\nAmbulance services are widely available in Israel. Ambulance services in the West Bank are available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. The U.S. government does not have knowledge of the standards of ambulance services in Gaza, but their capabilities have been degraded by the ongoing armed conflict between Hamas and Israel. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) operates in the West Bank and Gaza.\nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s entire  Travelers’ Health webpage  and general  Traveler Advice  for Israel.Traveler Advice for Israel.\nReview the  Traveler Advice webpage  that provides advice on medical considerations including:\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage for places you are traveling overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage on insurance coverage overseas  for more information. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  (see our webpage) to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\nPharmaceuticals\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy\nWater Quality\nAdventure Travel\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  While in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below is provided for general reference only and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.\nTraffic Laws:  Aggressive driving is commonplace, and many drivers fail to maintain safe following distances or signal before changing lanes or making turns. Overtaking at high-speed on undivided two-lane roads is common and may result in accidents. Drivers are also prone to stop suddenly on roads without warning, especially in the right lane. Drivers should use caution, as Israel has a high rate of fatalities from automobile accidents.\nPlease refer to our Road Safety page for more information. We suggest that you visit the website of the country’s national  tourist  office and Israel's  Ministry of Transport and Road Safety  for additional information on road safety.  \n  \n Aviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed that the Government of Israel’s Civil Aviation Authority is in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Israel’s air carrier operations.

For general information about Italian customs regulations, please read our  Customs Information  page and our  Italian Customs  website.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nPolitically motivated violence in Italy is most often connected to Italian internal developments or social issues. Italian authorities and foreign diplomatic facilities have found bombs outside public buildings, have received bomb threats, and have been targets of letter bombs, firebombs and Molotov cocktails in the past several years. These attacks generally occur at night, and although they have not targeted or injured U.S. citizens, you should remain aware of your surroundings and report any suspicious activity to local authorities.\nCrime:  Italy has a moderate rate of crime, especially for theft and economic crimes; violent crimes are rare. U.S. citizens should be aware of the following local circumstances:\nThe U.S. Secret Service in Rome is assisting Italian law enforcement authorities in investigating an increase in the appearance of ATM skimming devices. Here are some helpful hints to protect against and identify skimming devices:\nPotential for Natural Disasters:  Several major earthquake fault lines cross Italy, and earthquakes are frequent. High tides in Venice, flooding, and avalanches in mountainous areas may occasionally occur. The Italian Civil Protection agency has a robust capability to assist Italians and foreigners in the area of a natural disaster. Information about crisis preparedness and on-going crises affecting parts of Italy can be found on the Civil Protection web site at:  Civil Protection Italy . General information about disaster preparedness is also available online from the  U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA). Detailed information on Italy's fault lines is available from the  U.S. Geological Survey  (USGS).\nItaly also has several active volcanoes, including Mt. Etna in eastern Sicily. Travelers to Sicily should be aware of the possibility for travel disruptions, including airport closures, in the event of volcanic activity, and are advised to check the website of the  Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia  for detailed information and daily updates. Italy has many other areas of potential volcanic activity especially in the vicinity of Naples. Any visit to an active volcano or volcanic field bears a certain amount of risk. Eruptions can occur with little to no warning. Travelers should exercise caution, follow posted instructions, stay on authorized trails, and use reputable tour operators.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently and can be anti-American in nature, especially in areas hosting U.S. military bases. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Italy. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical attention at the nearest public hospital as soon as possible. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are also encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at +(39) 06-4674-1. Report crimes to the local police by dialing 112.

AIFVS provides legal and psychological assistance through a network of professionals associated with the NGO. Please visit  AIFVS  for more details.\nIf you are a  victim of a violent intentional crime,  you are entitled to compensation from the Italian government to cover the medical and welfare expenses you incurred, except for sexual assaults and murders cases where the compensation is due even if no medical and welfare expense was sustained. To be eligible for the compensation, your annual income must be within a certain limit. In addition, you must prove that you have already unsuccessfully tried to enforce the decision ordering compensation for damages. We recommend you contact an attorney licensed to practice in Italy for more information.\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or nearest Consulate for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Your U.S. passport will not prevent you from being detained, arrested, or prosecuted. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB RIGHTS:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Italy. Same sex civil unions are legally recognized in Italy. See our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of the  Department of State's Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance .  The law in Italy prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, and common in lodging and general infrastructure.

Public hospitals may not maintain the same standards as hospitals in the United States. It is not possible to obtain an itemized hospital bill from public hospitals, as required by many U.S. insurance companies, because the Italian National Health Service charges one inclusive rate for care services and room and board. Private hospitals require you to pay for all services up front and get reimbursed later from your insurance company.\nWe do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nIn Italy, end-of-life directives are not legal. Tourists should know that by law, hospitals will continue with lifesaving procedures indefinitely regardless of a person’ preferences stated in a will or advanced directive.\nPharmaceuticals:  The Italian Ministry of Health sets rules defining who and how prescriptions and medications can be imported into Italy. However, the Ministry of Health website does not have information in English. According to the Ministry of Health, foreigners entering Italy are allowed to bring personal medications for a period of 30 days, but it is recommended that travelers also bring a copy of their prescription with them. Travelers should not bring excess supplies of prescription drugs into the country and cannot bring prescription drugs for other people.\nThe import of medications into Italy by courier services or by mail is strictly regulated by Italian Customs laws. Italian customs clears all incoming shipments of medications, even small amounts for personal use. Delays in the release of medications by Italian Customs received by mail or by courier services are common. The receiving party must be able to provide a statement signed by a physician licensed in Italy, certifying:\nThe medication is essential for the patient, that he/she would be put in a life-threatening situation without it.\nThere is no substitute or equivalent medication available on the Italian market.\nExercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with minimal controls. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and the  Food and Drug Administration  websites for more information.\nVaccinations : Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFor further health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Many cities in Italy have air pollution levels similar to those in major U.S. cities. \nIn parts of Italy, the lack of adequate trash disposal and incineration sites has led to periodic accumulations of garbage. In some cases, residents have burned garbage, resulting in toxic emissions that can aggravate respiratory problems. \nVisit the  European Environment Agency’s website  for information on air quality in Italy.\nHealth Facilities:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals .

If you are traveling to Jamaica on a cruise, you may use another  Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  (WHTI) compliant document. However, we strongly recommend you obtain a passport before travel in case an emergency requires you to disembark and return by air. You do not need a visa for tourist travel up to 90 days. All other travelers will need a visa and/or work permit.\nVisit the  Passport, Immigration, & Citizenship Agency of Jamaica  or the  Embassy of Jamaica in Washington D.C.  websites for the most current visa information.\nExit Information:  Your departure tax is regularly included in the airfare. You won’t be charged an exit tax on your way out.\nHIV/AIDS restrictions:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Jamaica.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nCrime:  Violent crime, including sexual assault, is a serious problem throughout Jamaica, particularly in Kingston and Montego Bay. Jamaica’s police force often does not respond effectively to serious criminal incidents. When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a conclusive sentence. Families of U.S. citizens killed in accidents or homicides frequently wait a year or more for final death certificates to be issued by Jamaican authorities. Gated resorts are not immune to violent crime.\nRecommendations:\nInternational Financial Scams:   See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information. Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Jamaica. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include:\nThe most notorious Jamaican scam is the Lotto Scam, a kind of advance-fee fraud. The victim is led to believe that a Jamaican lottery prize will be released after the payment of “fees.”\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\nReport crimes to the local police at 119 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +1 (876) 702-6000.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSexual Assault:   Rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. Date rape drugs may be used at private parties and resorts.\nIf you are victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible. In a hotel, management should assist you with these communications.\nVictims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States. Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. Counseling is unlikely to be offered. Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly, and victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.\nRecommendations:\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws.  If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.  \nFuthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFirearms:  Jamaica strictly forbids importing or possessing firearms in Jamaica without prior authorization of the Firearms Licensing Authority of Jamaica. A U.S. concealed carry permit does  not  allow you to bring a firearm or ammunition into Jamaica. On November 1, 2022, the Firearms (Prohibition, Restriction and Regulation) Act 2022 went into effect.  This new law includes mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years for possession of even a single cartridge.\nIf you bring an unauthorized firearm, firearm components, firearm parts, or ammunition to Jamaica, you  will  be arrested and prosecuted. This will result in a large fine and/or incarceration for an unspecified amount of time. Bringing mace, pepper spray, or knives into Jamaica without authorization will also lead to arrest.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Jamaican law contains specific prohibitions on “acts of gross indecency” – generally interpreted as any kind of physical intimacy – between persons of the same sex, in public or in private, and provides punishment of up to 10 years in prison. There is also a law that specifically prohibits even consensual same-sex sexual conduct between men.\nNegative attitudes towards LGB issues are widespread in Jamaica. There are continued reports of serious discrimination and abuse against LGB individuals, including:\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nLesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) individuals have been targeted through the use of dating apps, especially apps popular within the LGB communities. Criminals have used dating apps to lure foreign visitors into meeting in public spaces such as hotel restaurants and bars, and then later assaulting, threatening , and or robbing the victims. Police have not been responsive in making arrests or prosecuting assailants in these cases.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Jamaica prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, although the law is not reliably enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and information. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. There is a significant difference in accessibility between major cities such as Kingston and Montego Bay compared to accessibility in Jamaica’s smaller communities. Qualified and certified service providers such as sign language interpreters and personal assistants and rental, repair services, and replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices can be difficult to locate outside of the major cities.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in Jamaica,  dial 119 .\nAmbulance services are:\nWe do not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the  Government of Jamaica  to ensure the medication is legal in Jamaica.\nVaccinations:   Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals  here .  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Jamaicans drive on the left side of the road. Here are some notes for your safety:\nTraffic Laws:\nPublic Transportation:\nSee our  Road Safety  page and the website of Jamaica’s  national tourist office  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Jamaica’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of air carrier operations in Jamaica. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Jamaica should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) broadcast warnings ."

Please consult the  DOD Foreign Clearance Guide  before leaving the United States.\nSee  the Immigration Bureau of Japan’s website  for various immigration procedures.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Japan. \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nFor police services in Japan, dial 110. For fire or ambulance services, dial 119.\nCrime:  Crime against U.S. citizens in Japan is generally low and usually involves personal disputes, theft, or vandalism. In addition:\nEntertainment and Nightlife Districts in Tokyo: \nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams. \nPolice reports must be filed at the nearest police station prior to departure from Japan. The Japanese police cannot accept reports filed from overseas. Report crimes to the local police at 110 and contact the U.S. Embassy at 03-3224-5000 (011-81-3-3224-5000 from overseas).  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nContacting Police, Fire and Ambulance Services:  You can reach the police throughout Japan by dialing 110. Fire and ambulance services can be contacted by dialing 119.  Note that English-speaking dispatchers may not be available. Please review advice on  “Calling for Help”  on our  website . If you need assistance, you should be able to describe your address/location in Japanese or find someone who can do so, since few police officers speak English.\nDomestic Violence:  Victim's assistance resources or battered women's shelters exist in major urban areas, but are difficult for foreigners to access. These types of resources are also generally unavailable in rural areas. Investigations of sexual assault crimes are often conducted without female police officers present, and police typically ask about the victim's sexual history and previous relationships.\nTourism:  The Victim's assistance resources or battered women's shelters exist in major urban areas, but are difficult for foreigners to access. These types of resources are also generally unavailable in rural areas. Investigations of sexual assault crimes are often conducted without female police officers present, and police typically ask about the victim's sexual history and previous relationships.\nSee our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to Japanese law while you are in Japan. If you violate Japanese laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, imprisoned, or deported. If you are arrested in Japan,  even for a minor offense , you may be held in detention without bail for several months or more during the investigation and legal proceedings.\nSome offences are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of Japanese law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nThe vast majority of arrests of U.S. citizens in Japan are for drug-related offenses. Japanese authorities aggressively pursue drug smugglers and users, including recreational users with sophisticated detection equipment, \"sniffing\" dogs, blood tests, “stop and frisk” tactics, and other methods. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking a drug that is illegal in Japan are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and fines. Please note that some drugs which may be legal in certain jurisdictions outside of Japan, including marijuana and synthetic drugs, remain illegal in Japan. This also applies to certain prescription drugs that doctors in the United States may prescribe.  Japanese law makes no distinction between medical and recreational marijuana; therefore, having a prescription for medical marijuana will  not  help you avoid arrest or prosecution. Even possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal medical or recreational use can result in a long jail sentence and fine. Japanese customs officials carefully screen incoming packages, and individuals who are mailed drugs can be arrested and prosecuted as drug traffickers.   \nConfiscation of Prescription Drugs and Other Medication:  It is important to note that some medications that are routinely prescribed in the United States, including Adderall and marijuana, are strictly prohibited in Japan. The Japanese government decides which medications may be imported legally into Japan. The Embassy and Consulates of Japan in the United States have limited information available and do not have a comprehensive list of specific medications or ingredients. Please see more  information on importing medicines  into Japan.\nYou must carry your U.S. passport or Japanese Residence Card (Zairyu Kado) with you at all times. In Japan, you may be taken in for questioning if you do not have your passport or Japanese residence card to show your identity and status in Japan (e.g., as a visitor, student, worker, or permanent resident).\nIt is illegal to work in Japan while in tourist or visa-waiver status. Overstaying your visa or working illegally may lead to fines of several thousands of dollars, and in some cases, re-entry bans as long as 10 years, or indefinitely for drug offenders. For additional information, please see  Japan’s Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act  and contact the  Japanese Embassy  or nearest Japanese Consulate in the United States for more information.\nDriving under the influence of alcohol could also land you immediately in jail. The blood-alcohol limit in Japan is 0.03%. Punishments can be up to 10,000 USD in fines and up to five years in prison.\nPossession of a gun or ammunition is a crime in Japan. Carrying a knife with a locking blade, or a folding blade that is longer than 5.5 cm (a little more than two inches), is illegal in Japan. U.S. citizens and U.S. military personnel have been arrested and detained for more than 10 days for carrying pocket knives that are legal in the United States but illegal in Japan. The possession of lock-picking tools is illegal in Japan.\nEstablishing a Business : Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nA  list of English-speaking lawyers  located throughout Japan is available on our  website .\nArrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See the Department of State’s  webpage  and the Embassy’s  website  for additional information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice’s website  for more information .\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Japan.\nLaws governing rape, sexual commerce, and other activity involving sexual relations do not apply to same-sex sexual activity. This leads to lower penalties for perpetrators of same-sex rape and sexual assault and greater legal ambiguity surrounding same-sex prostitution.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Japan prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities. Japanese disability laws require the public sector to provide reasonable accommodations and the private sector to make best efforts in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other services; however, there are no penalties for noncompliance. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.\nAlthough Japan’s accessibility laws mandate that new construction projects for public use include provisions for persons with disabilities, older buildings are not likely to have been retrofitted for accessibility. At major train stations, airports, and hotels, travelers with disabilities should encounter few accessibility problems. Note that many smaller stations are inaccessible to those who cannot climb stairs. Information on travel in Japan for travelers with disabilities is available at  Accessible Japan .\nTravelers with disabilities can learn more about resources available in country from the Japan National Tourism Organization’s  traveling with a disability page .\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nConditions at Prisons and Detention Facilities:  Japanese prisons and detention facilities maintain internal order through a regime of very strict discipline.  U.S. citizen prisoners often complain of stark, austere living conditions and psychological isolation.  Heating in winter can be inadequate in some facilities, food portions can be significantly smaller than what many may be accustomed to, and access to specialized medical care, particularly mental health care, at detention facilities and prisons is sometimes limited. Additional  information on arrests in Japan  is available on our embassy website.\nCustoms Regulations:  Please contact the Japanese Embassy or nearest Japanese consulate in the United States, or  visit the Japanese Customs website  for specific information regarding import restrictions and customs requirements.\nJapanese customs authorities encourage the use of an Admission Temporaire/Temporary Admission (ATA) Carnet in order to temporarily import professional equipment, commercial samples, and/or goods for exhibitions and trade fairs into Japan.  For additional information, please call (212) 354-4480, or  email the U.S. CIB  for details.\nPets:  The Japanese  Animal Quarantine Service  (AQS) sets procedures for importing pets. At a minimum, the process will take seven to eight months, though the process can take up to a year before a pet may enter Japan. Advance planning is critical. You can find more information about  importing a pet into Japan  or information about  exporting a pet from Japan  on our  Embassy website.\nEmployment Issues:  U.S. citizens should not come to Japan to work without having the proper employment visa arranged ahead of time. Teaching English, even privately, and serving as hosts/hostesses are both considered \"work\" in Japan and are illegal without the proper visa.\nSome U.S.-based employment agencies and Japanese employers do not fully or correctly represent the true nature of employment terms and conditions. A minimum requirement for effectively seeking the protection of Japanese labor law is a written and signed work contract. If there is no signed contract, Japanese authorities are not able to act on behalf of foreign workers. If you are coming to Japan to work, carefully review your contract and the history and reputation of your Japanese employer before traveling to Japan. Complaints against U.S.-based employment agencies or recruiters may be directed to the  Better Business Bureau  or the Office of the Attorney General in the relevant state(s).\nDisaster Preparedness : Japan is prone to natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis, and landslides. See the  Embassy’s  webpage for recommendations and steps you can take to prepare for an emergency. The Japan Tourism Organization’s  Safety Tips app  and  NHK World app  provide Japanese government emergency “J-Alerts” to your cell phone in English through push notifications. “J-Alerts” can provide early warning emergency alerts on earthquakes predicted in a specific area, sometimes seconds before an earthquake hits. \nRadiation: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant : The Government of Japan continues to closely monitor the conditions at and around the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. You should comply with all travel restrictions and cautions put into place by the Government of Japan for areas surrounding the plant. For more information, contact the  Japan Nuclear Regulation Authority .\nFor police service in Japan, dial 110. For fire or ambulance, dial 119.\nAmbulance services are widely available but receiving hospitals may decline to accept inbound patients unless they can provide proof of funds to pay for services.\nCOVID-19 Testing:\nCOVID-19 Vaccines:\nThe Department of State does not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Some care providers in Japan only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of  Japan’s Ministry of Health website  to ensure the medication is legal in Japan; possession, use, or importation of a prescription drug that is illegal in Japan may result in arrest and criminal prosecution. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. U.S. prescriptions are not honored in Japan, so if you need ongoing prescription medicine, you should arrive with a sufficient supply for your stay in Japan or enough until you are able to see a local care provider.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended  by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nJapan has a national health insurance system which is available only to those foreigners with long-term visas for Japan. National health insurance does not pay for medical evacuation. Medical caregivers in Japan may require payment in full at the time of treatment or concrete proof of ability to pay before they will treat a foreigner who is not a member of the national health insurance plan.\nU.S.-style and standard psychological and psychiatric care can be difficult to locate outside of major urban centers in Japan and generally is not available outside of Japan's major cities. Extended psychiatric care can be very difficult to obtain.\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nRoad Conditions and Safety : Driving in Japan can be complicated and expensive. Traffic moves on the left side of the road. Those who cannot read the language will have trouble understanding road signs. Highway tolls can be very high, and city traffic is often very congested. A 20-mile trip in the Tokyo area may take two hours. There is virtually no legal roadside or curbside parking; however, traffic is commonly blocked or partially blocked by those illegally parked curbside. In mountainous areas, roads are often closed during the winter, and cars should be equipped with tire chains. Roads in Japan are much narrower than those in the United States.\nTraffic Laws : Japanese law provides that all drivers in Japan are held liable in the event of an accident, and assesses fault in an accident on all parties. Japanese compulsory insurance (JCI) is mandatory for all automobile owners and drivers in Japan. Most short-term visitors choose not to drive in Japan. Turning right or left on red lights is not permitted in Japan, and all passengers are required to fasten their seat belts.\nJapan has a national 0.03 percent blood-alcohol-level standard for driving, and drivers stopped for driving under the influence of intoxicants will have their licenses confiscated. If you are found guilty of driving under the influence, speeding, or blatantly careless driving resulting in injury, you are subject to up to 15 years in prison. \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. The National Police Agency (NPA) oversees the administration and enforcement of traffic laws in Japan. You can find further information in English on the  NPA English website . Information about roadside assistance, rules of the road, and obtaining a Japanese driver's license is available in English from the  Japan Automobile Federation (JAF) web site . See  the Japan National Tourism Organization’s website  for car rental and driving in Japan.\nEmergency Assistance : For roadside assistance, please contact the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF) at 03-5730-0111 in Tokyo, 072-645-0111 in Osaka, 011-857-8139 in Sapporo, 092-841-5000 in Fukuoka, or 098-877-9163 in Okinawa.\nInternational Driving Permits (IDPs):  An international driving permit (IDP) issued in the United States by the American Automobile Association (AAA) or the American Automobile Touring Alliance (AATA) is required of short-term visitors who drive in Japan. You must obtain an IDP issued in your country of residence prior to arriving in Japan. The U.S. Embassy andU.S. consulates do not issue IDPs. IDPs issued via the Internet and/or by other organizations are not valid in Japan. \nForeign residents in Japan who use an IDP may be fined or arrested. In practice, the term “resident” involves more than simply visa status or length of stay in Japan and is determined by the police. In short, a driver license from country outside Japan is not a substitute for a valid Japanese license for foreign residents. See the U.S. Embassy’s  website  for more information on driving in Japan.\nAviation Safety Oversight : The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Japan’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Japan’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA's safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel : Mariners planning travel to Japan should also check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts  in the Alerts section of the Embassy’s messages. Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) broadcast warnings website portal  select “broadcast warnings.”"

Travelers may be denied entry at ports of entry, including land border crossings, if they are known to have HIV. This policy, however, is rarely enforced and Jordanian authorities do not screen for HIV/AIDS at the border. Jordan does not permit residency for foreign nationals with HIV/AIDS. Travelers seeking to extend their stay beyond the initial timeframe are legally required to have an HIV/AIDS test performed at a government medical facility as part of a general medical screening. Those who fail to submit to the test or who test positive for HIV are denied residency and may be deported. For further information, please see the  Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  website before you travel.\nTravelers should check the  Country Information  and  Travel Advisories  for all countries they plan to visit during their travel to the region.

Jordan also maintains honorary consulates in Detroit, MI, Chicago, IL, and San Francisco, CA. \n \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nThe threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Transnational and indigenous terrorist groups have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks in Jordan. Violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS), and al-Qa’ida, directly or indirectly have conducted or supported attacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and Western interests and “soft” targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan’s prominent role in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future terrorist incidents.\nIn general, terrorists often do not distinguish between U.S. government personnel and private U.S. citizens. Terrorists may target areas frequented by Westerners, such as tourist sites, hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, liquor stores, shopping malls, transportation hubs, places of worship, expatriate residential areas, and schools. In light of these security concerns, U.S. citizens should maintain a high level of vigilance:\nU.S. government personnel overseas have been advised to take the same precautions.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:  Statistically, petty crime is the most common form of crime that U.S. citizens and other Western nationals experience in Jordan, especially at tourist sites and in crowded areas. Pickpockets, purse snatchers, and opportunistic thieves are known to target foreigners in the narrow and crowded streets of the older parts of Amman’s city center. Travelers should be alert in these areas and in all tourist locations in Jordan. Jordanian police have warned the public to exercise vigilance when leaving banks or ATMs, to reduce likelihood of targeting by thieves.\nThefts of vehicles, assaults, robbery, and attempted residential break-ins have also been reported. Take care not to display valuables in your car or on your person and be sure to lock car doors and windows.\nViolent crime does occur, but U.S. citizens or other Westerners are rarely targeted. In the past, the Embassy has received reports of firearms being discharged at vehicles being driven by Westerners. Celebratory gunfire is common, especially during major festivals, sporting events, or the biannual release of high school test scores.\nDo not buy counterfeit or pirated goods. Not only are the pirated copies illegal in the United States, if you purchase them, you will also be breaking local law. Most DVDs, CDs, and software available for sale in Jordan are pirated.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nIn general, demonstrations remain peaceful. However, some have turned violent, even when intended to be peaceful, leading security officials to intervene. Travelers should avoid all protests and large gatherings of people. Many demonstrations occur on Thursday evenings near government buildings and on Fridays near mosques following mid-day prayers. You should exercise special sensitivity and caution when visiting or traveling near mosques and religious sites during holy days and Fridays. Demonstrations and other forms of unrest have occurred on public university campuses in Jordan. Some acts of violence on university campuses have involved the use of firearms. Although generally peaceful, anti-U.S. demonstrations have also taken place in front of the U.S. Embassy.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at 911. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence are encouraged to contact 911 and ask to be put in touch with the Family Protection Directorate, part of the national police, which is staffed 24/7 and has some English-speaking personnel. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. U.S. citizen victims of crime may contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance at (6) 590-6950.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call 911 and ask to speak to the Family Protection Directorate which is tasked with assisting and investigating issues of domestic violence.   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nFlash Flooding:  Certain areas of Jordan, including Petra, the Dead Sea, and other tourist areas, are prone to heavy rain and flash flooding, especially from October-March. Roads and bridges may become impassable and the Jordanian government may close tourist areas completely. The first rains of the season in particular often cause flooding throughout Amman and other cities in Jordan. It is important to watch the weather reports and heed local recommendations. The Jordanian government may send out Arabic language text messages to all cell phones registered in Jordan when inclement weather, such as heavy rain, occurs.\nTribal Violence:  Clashes between feuding tribes, clans, or families periodically erupt without notice and sometimes involve violence, including the use of firearms. In some cases, Jordanian security services are slow to respond or may opt to let the violence subside before intervening.\nSyria and Iraq Borders:  U.S. citizens should avoid the border areas with Syria and Iraq. All U.S. government personnel on official travel must receive prior permission to visit any area within 10 km of the Jordan-Syria border, except the tourist site of Umm Qais or the city of Irbid. U.S. government personnel must also have permission for official travel on Highway 10 east of the town of Ruwayshid toward the Iraq border, or for official visits to refugee camps anywhere in Jordan. Personal travel by U.S. government employees to the border areas or refugee camps is not permitted. Police and security officials have arrested weapon and drug smugglers, as well as foreign fighters attempting to enter Syria to fight in the country’s ongoing conflict. In the past, fighting in Syria has occurred close to Syria’s border with Jordan, and some munitions have landed within Jordan’s borders. On June 21, 2016, ISIS conducted a car bombing attack against a Jordanian military facility in the country’s northeast, along the border with Syria, killing seven Jordanian soldiers. The Department of State warns against all travel into Syria and Iraq. Please see the  Travel Advisories  and  Country Information  for Syria and Iraq for further information.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nThe Jordanian constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press with some restrictions. Insulting the King or members of the Royal Family may lead to detainment or imprisonment. Additionally, the Jordanian government considers proselytizing to Muslims (including the distribution of religious material) illegal, and anyone undertaking these activities is subject to prosecution, imprisonment, and deportation. Please see the information below on Islam as the state religion of Jordan.\nJordanian courts may impose criminal penalties, including imprisonment, for alleged infractions that in the United States would be resolved in civil courts. The U.S. Embassy is aware of several cases involving business or financial disputes that resulted in lengthy pre-trial detention and imprisonment under local financial crimes laws.\nIt is illegal to use, possess and/or distribute drugs, including marijuana and its derivatives, in Jordan. Jordan has strict drug laws and enforces them readily. Drug possession/use is one of the five main offenses that falls under the umbrella of the state security court and is subject to a different set of criminal procedures than other offenses. Accused offenders can be detained for up to two weeks without charges. In addition, after being referred to the state security public prosecutor, the accused offender can be detained for an additional 15 days renewable for further investigation, as long as the extension does not exceed a total of two months. This delay can result in the Embassy not being notified about the detainment because an official arrest has not taken place.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are a U.S citizen and are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFamily Circumstances:  The U.S. Embassy is aware of cases where U.S. citizens have been subject to domestic violence and abandonment by their spouses, including incidents of restrictions of movement through travel holds, loss of custody of children or forced marriage. Women and children should pay particular attention to any warning signs, including husbands or other family members withholding money or travel documents after arrival in Jordan. Cases of domestic violence should be reported to the Family Protection Department. Travelers should also be aware that U.S. laws cannot protect U.S. citizens when they are outside of the United States.\nTravel Holds:  Under Jordanian law, any adult male may prevent his minor children from leaving Jordan by simply registering a hold on their travel with the Jordanian authorities. Adults may place travel holds on their spouses pursuant to a court order from a Jordanian court. Adult male relatives (uncles, brothers, grandfathers) may also petition Jordanian courts for a travel hold on their unmarried adult female relatives. Immigration officials may prevent minor children traveling with their mothers from departing Jordan without the father’s affirmative consent. This is possible even if the child or woman holds only U.S. nationality. Jordanian authorities consider disputes surrounding travel holds as private family matters, and the Embassy is extremely limited in its ability to intervene. Travel holds may only be removed by the person who placed them or by a court. Please see  Jordan’s International Parental Child Abduction (IPCA) page  for further information.\nMale Military Requirement:  U.S. citizen males who also hold Jordanian citizenship may be subject to laws that impose military service obligations on Jordanians. Jordanian men under age 40 are required to register for service in the Jordanian military. Those subject to registration may be prevented from leaving Jordan until exit permission is obtained from appropriate Jordanian authorities. This permission is often granted to U.S. citizens, but may take some time to obtain and may be limited to a single exit.\nDual Citizenship:  The Government of Jordan considers U.S.-Jordanian dual nationals to be Jordanian citizens. Local authorities typically do not notify the U.S. Embassy of arrests, detentions, or accidents involving dual nationals. For this reason, dual nationals in particular should carry copies of their U.S. passports with them at all times so that evidence of their identity and U.S. citizenship is readily available for local authorities.\nFor additional information, see our information on  Dual Nationality .\nCustoms:  Jordanian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Jordan of items such as drugs, firearms, poisons, chemicals, explosives, pornographic materials, communications equipment, drones and antiquities, among other items. You should contact the  Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  in Washington, D.C., or one of the Jordanian consulates in the United States, if you seek specific information regarding customs requirements.\nPlease also refer to our  Customs Information  page for additional information.\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (Drones):  Tourists’ use of smaller drones is becoming increasingly popular. However, drones are illegal for personal use in Jordan, and persons seeking to bring any drone into Jordan must first obtain pre-authorization and approval from authorities before entry and use.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nIslam is the state religion of Jordan. The Jordanian government generally does not interfere in religious practices. Some religious groups, however, cannot obtain legal recognition of their denominations. On official documents such as birth and wedding certificates, the Government of Jordan only allows affiliation with legally recognized faiths: Islam, certain Christian denominations, and Judaism. Not listing an affiliated faith or listing a faith outside those recognized by the government is generally not permitted. Activities such as proselytizing or encouraging conversion to any faith other than Islam are prohibited. U.S. citizens have been detained, arrested, denied re-entry and/or deported for discussing or trying to engage Jordanians in discussions about religion, even if such discussions also involve other activities, such as humanitarian aid. Jordanian officials may not warn individuals before a detention, arrest, denial of entry or deportation; any warnings received should be taken extremely seriously.\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Jordan. However, laws against adultery or breaches of modesty may be used against LGB travelers. Public displays of affection between individuals in general, and especially of the same sex are not considered culturally acceptable. Foreigners exhibiting such behavior or expressing themselves outside of traditional M/F norms in terms of dress or appearance may face greater risk of official and societal harassment and/or be targets of violence. Gay and lesbian Jordanians frequently hide their sexuality, even from family members. Family members who discover that a relative is LGB may target them for “honor” crimes.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance .  While in Jordan, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is found in the United States .  Outside of a few upscale hotels in the capital, individuals with disabilities will find almost no accessible accommodations. Similarly, there are very few accessible restaurants, shops, or historical sites. Transportation is not accessible and sidewalks and crosswalks, even in the main cities, are not accessible. Handicap-accessible toilets and bathrooms, even in major hospitals, are generally not available. However, at least one local NGO ( accessiblejordan.com ) has created a website which reports accessibility of tourist sites and other locations in Jordan. Travelers who rely on special accessibility requirements or assistance are encouraged to research on-line before planning travel to Jordan.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Women visiting and residing in Jordan have reported incidents of sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, and assault. The Embassy continues to receive sporadic reports regarding incidents of harassment and sexual assaults involving taxis and taxi drivers. Some have included physical assaults. To reduce the likelihood of being victimized, women should take precautions such as avoiding travel to unfamiliar areas at night, traveling alone, and riding in the front seat of a taxi. Additionally, dress modestly when in public. Carrying a cell phone at all times is recommended. Immediately report any incidents to the Family Protection Department by calling 911. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nModern medical care and medicines are generally available in Jordan’s main cities but not always in outlying areas. Most acute and chronic medical conditions can be treated. When called, ambulances are often slow to arrive and personnel generally have only a basic level of training. Most hospitals in Jordan, especially in Amman, are privately owned. Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment or a high deposit for services.\nSeasonal dust storms that envelop the country for days or weeks each spring may significantly aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma or sinus problems.\nFor emergency services in Jordan, dial  911 .\nAmbulance services are not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of  doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth Facilities in General:\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\nMedical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling.\nPharmaceuticals:\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:\nWater Quality:\nAdventure Travel:\n  Air Quality:\nVisit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   While in Jordan, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions and driving habits that differ significantly from those in the United States.   The information below concerning Jordan is provided for general reference only and may not be completely accurate in a particular location or circumstance.\nU.S. Embassy Amman has advised its employees to avoid driving at night outside the Amman metropolitan area due to road conditions, poorly lighted rural roads, livestock crossings, and erratic behavior by other drivers. \nIt is typical for drivers in Jordan not to signal for turns or lane changes. Drivers tend to be aggressive and inattentive to surroundings, and cars operate very closely together on highways. Jordanian roads are particularly treacherous during the rainy season, which runs from October to March. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter months (December to February), making many roads – even major highways – impassable for several days. Driving in Amman also is hazardous in the summer months of June to September when Jordan experiences an influx of visitors from other countries in the region. Highway traffic is heavy around the Muslim holidays when many Jordanian expatriates return to Jordan for family visits.\nThe Desert Highway outside Aqaba, the Dead Sea Highway from Amman, and the King’s Highway between Petra and Madaba, all popular tourist routes, are dangerous because they are narrow, winding, steep, and crowded with trucks. Try to avoid using these roads at night. When driving in both urban and rural areas, motorists should beware of unmarked speed bumps and livestock, including camels, sheep, and goats. Collisions with livestock are common.\nMuwaqqar road (also known as Highway 40) which runs from the Desert Highway east to Al-Azraq city is dangerous due to poor road conditions, poor shoulders, and a high volume of heavy truck traffic. This road is the scene of frequent vehicular accidents, including fatal collisions. This road leads to several popular tourist sites, the “Desert Castles,” but motorists should use this road with caution.    \nAs a result of these factors, traffic accidents are frequent and continue to be the largest cause of unnatural death in Jordan.\nThere have been reported attacks on various tourist buses on the highway between Amman and Aqaba, known as the Desert Highway, due to ongoing business or tribal disputes. Attackers, who are believed to be private citizens, throw objects often resulting in broken windshields and interrupted trips.\nLicensed drivers must carry local third-party insurance with sufficient coverage for accidents resulting in injury or death. Drivers who are involved in an accident should remain at the scene and immediately call the police and emergency personnel in case injuries have occurred. Police frequently hold the driver’s license or passport in order to prevent the driver from fleeing. Identification documents can be recovered at the police station. It is common for foreign drivers to be blamed for accidents, regardless of the actual circumstances of the incident. Following an accident, the other party may file criminal or civil charges to seek damages. U.S. citizen drivers have occasionally been detained by police as a result. The U.S. Embassy recommends that U.S. citizen drivers in a traffic accident retain  private legal counsel .\nTraffic Laws:   Drivers must have a valid Jordanian license or a valid foreign license with an International Driving Permit to drive in Jordan. U.S. visitors who intend to drive should obtain an International Driving Permit before travel to Jordan. Temporary visitors may use their valid American driver's licenses only to rent “green” plated rental cars.\nPolice may pull over speeding drivers, as well as those believed to be driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\nPublic Transportation:  Jordan has abundant taxi and ride-share services. Please see the Crime section for more information on sexual harassment and assault involving taxi drivers, as well as safety tips when using public or private transportation. Visitors should make arrangements for taxis via their hotel and request that drivers not pick up additional passengers en route to their destinations. On-call taxi services, such as Uber and Careem, also operate in Jordan. Licensed on-call taxi drivers will have government-issued license sticker on the upper corner of the vehicle windshield on the passenger seat side. Some on-call taxi drivers operate without a license and are subject to possible traffic violations. Mass transportation options, are not recommended and U.S. personnel at Embassy Amman are not authorized to use public buses due to security and safety concerns. Jordanian security authorities often establish checkpoints, especially on roads leading to popular tourist destinations, where drivers are expected to stop and present their identity documents. All drivers should stop when directed to do so and comply with the instructions provided to them by the authorities.\nEmergencies should be referred to the Civil Defense Department by dialing 911.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of  Jordan’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities . For information on driving regulations, please contact the  Embassy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan  at 3504 International Drive NW, Washington, DC 20008, by telephone at (202) 966-2664.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Jordan’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Jordan’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nDue to ongoing military activity throughout Syria, the FAA has issued guidance prohibiting U.S. air carriers from flight operations in Syrian airspace, and cautioning those carriers concerning operations in neighboring airspaces. Further information may be found on the  FAA's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Jordan should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

Matatus are commonly known to be the greatest danger to other vehicles and pedestrians.  U.S. government personnel are prohibited from using matatus.\nInjuries and fatalities involving two-wheeled motorcycle taxis, called “boda bodas,” are equally common.

Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the Embassy at 2259-1001. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  Victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is generally regulated according to best practices and safety inspections and rules are regularly enforced.

In the event of an injury, adequate medical treatment is available throughout the country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. Individuals who violate local laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits and licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nAlcohol and Drugs:\nThe following actions are illegal and may also lead to prosecution, imprisonment, and immediate deportation:\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and  the Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information. \n\nTravel Bans:  Business disputes, court orders to pay a settlement, immigration violations, or government investigations into both criminal and civil issues may result in the imposition of a travel ban, which will prohibit departure from Kuwait until the issue is resolved and the travel ban is lifted. U.S. citizens in Kuwait who are involved in disputes or investigations can check whether they have a travel ban by entering their civil ID number on the Kuwaiti Ministry of Interior website, found  here . Since multiple Kuwaiti government agencies can impose travel bans, this database is not exhaustive. More information on travel bans in Kuwait is available  here . \nChildren Born Out of Wedlock:  Sexual relations outside of marriage are a criminal offense. Parents may not be able to obtain a Kuwait birth certificate or residence permit for a child born out of wedlock and may be subject to prosecution and/or fines to document the birth of the child.\nCustoms:  Alcohol, pork products, and pornography are prohibited.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.

See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual activity between men is illegal. The law punishes consensual intercourse between men of full age (21 and older) with imprisonment of up of to seven years. Men of full age who engage in consensual intercourse with men under age 21 may be imprisoned up to ten years. No laws criminalize same-sex sexual activity between women. Some LGB travelers have reported difficulties entering Kuwait on a passport bearing a name and photo that do not correspond to their sex at birth, including harassment, detention, abuse, and assault by security forces. Societal discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation   is common.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report on Kuwait  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Accessibility and accommodations in Kuwait are different from those in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with permanent physical, sensory, intellectual, and mental disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other government services. The law also mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities.\n Public transportation is generally inaccessible for patrons with disabilities. Accessible parking spaces are marked, but often unavailable. Most medical facilities and public buildings have wheelchair ramps and elevators. Access to sign language interpretation is limited; Americans needing American Sign Language interpretation should plan ahead and have contact information for companies offering distance interpretation services through mobile phone apps, video phones, and other modalities.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Many public places have dress codes for women requiring shoulders and knees to be covered. Women, especially those traveling alone, should exercise particular caution on public transit, when traveling via taxi, and in conservative or isolated areas. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nHealthcare is adequate and accessible both in the government-run system and many private institutions. The government facilities provide services for foreigners at reasonable costs, and payment for all services is expected in advance. Government facilities offer more specialty care services, though wait times are often long and difficult to access for non-nationals. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. Some medical services are below U.S. standards. Most prescription and over-the-counter medicines are readily available at pharmacies. Emergency services are generally very responsive.\nWe do not pay medical bills:  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers in Kuwait will accept cash or credit card payments. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .

We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Driving in Kuwait is extremely hazardous due to excessive speeding, distracted driving, road rage, lax enforcement of traffic regulations, and a high volume of traffic. All major highways in Kuwait are dangerous due to excessive speeding. Roads have adequate signage. Passersby and emergency personnel react to accidents appropriately. Exercise increased caution when driving at night as some drivers do no use headlights. Drivers should avoid driving after heavy rainstorms or through standing water, be alert for flooded areas, and monitor local media for road closures and weather updates.\nTraffic Laws:\nPublic Transportation:\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Kuwait’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Kuwait’s air carrier operations.

There have been reports of officials intentionally not stamping passports of visitors entering the country. When this occurs, visitors are unable to prove they legally entered. \nVisa Requirements:  See the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic’s  website  for visa information.\nU.S. citizens who enter the Kyrgyz Republic without a visa may stay up to 60 days but must depart and remain outside of the Kyrgyz Republic for an equal amount of time. In other words, in a 120-day period, they may be present in the Kyrgyz Republic for 60 days. \nTravelers who plan to stay longer than 60 days should apply for the appropriate visa category  electronically  and register their stay with the appropriate government body. Additional information on the registration process can be found on the website for the  Ministry of Digital Development of the Kyrgyz Republic . Travelers who stay longer than their allotted 60 days must pay an administrative fine, apply for an exit visa prior to their departure, and should contact the Consular Department of the MFA in advance of their departure if they know that they have overstayed their visa-free period. Individuals who are already in the country and who need to register their stay should be able to do so without leaving the country. \nTravelers can contact the Consular Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with questions by calling +996 312 663 070, +996 703 428 865 (WhatsApp) or email at  e-visa@mfa.gov.kg .\nA ten-year, multi-entry visa is also available at any Kyrgyz embassy abroad.

Please verify this information with the  Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic  before you travel. \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our website.\nCrime:  The greatest threat to travelers is street crime. There have been reports of muggings of foreigners in downtown Bishkek at night and areas outside of Bishkek. You should limit travel to the Batken province (Oblast). Other common crimes include auto theft and pickpocketing in crowded places such as markets, especially Bishkek’s Osh Bazaar, large department stores, internet cafes, and on public transportation. While violent crime is rare in Bishkek, attackers do not always avoid violent confrontation with their victims. \nThe police are generally responsive to reports of crimes. \nHarassment and extortion by imposters, genuine law enforcement, and other officials does occur. Never voluntarily give your wallet to anybody. If pressured by a police officer, tell the officer that you will report his behavior to the U.S. Embassy and to the officer’s supervisors. Try to obtain the officer's name, badge number, and license plate number, and note where the incident happened. \nDemonstrations  are rare due to a ban on demonstrations outside a single location in Bishkek. Despite the ban, spontaneous demonstrations sometimes take place in response to political or economic issues, such as protests in May 2024 targeting Indian and Pakistani students studying in Bishkek. \nThe security situation remains fluid in areas along the Kyrgyz-Tajik border  due to ethnic and cross-border tensions, as well as the presence of narco-trafficking routes. Border areas in Batken province are closed to foreigners and travel restrictions requiring a permit are enforced along the Chinese and Tajik borders. Border areas with Tajikistan in Batken province are particularly sensitive and the location of a significant police and military presence. U.S. government employees are restricted from traveling to Batken province without prior authorization from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek. \nInternational Financial Scams : See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.

See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nU.S. Service Members:  Country clearance through Aircraft and Personnel Automated Clearance System (APACS) is required before arrival. \nHunting and Trekking Issues:  It is illegal to hunt without a proper license. You must obtain a permit from the Kyrgyz government prior to arrival in country to import or own firearms in the country. \nForeigners who do not have official permission to hunt or take animals out of the country may face criminal and/or civil charges.\nHikers and adventure travelers should be prepared for unexpected weather like rockslides, mudslides, avalanches, heavy rain and snow with little to no warning. Cell phone reception in popular hiking areas is limited or nonexistent. Search and rescue response is extremely limited, and local teams do not have the resources or capabilities of rescue teams in North American and European countries.\nMobile Device Registration:  All mobile devices sold in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic ,  imported through international postal or cargo shipments, and/or brought by the user from abroad for personal use must have their IMEI codes registered in the Kyrgyz government system for identifying communication devices.

Medical staff in the Kyrgyz Republic rarely speak English, and prices for treatment are not fixed. \nPsychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions. \nFor emergency services in the Kyrgyz Republic,  dial 112 . \nAmbulance services are not widely available, and the training and availability of emergency responders may be well below U.S. standards. Emergency responders may not be present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Bishkek, Osh, and other large cities. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment and are typically not staffed with trained paramedics. Injured or seriously ill travelers, particularly outside of metropolitan areas, may prefer to take a taxi, private ambulance, or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance. \nThe U.S. government does not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. \nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications. \nMedications:  Always carry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic accidents involving serious injury to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are common. \nMany city roads are hazardous due to potholes, uncovered manholes, poor lighting, and pedestrians ignoring oncoming traffic. \nThere is no roadside assistance infrastructure. Outside of metropolitan areas, roads are generally poor. \nMountain roads in the Kyrgyz Republic are often narrow and treacherous, and may close without notice due to snow, ice, or rockslides. Guardrails and barriers are often missing. Livestock is free ranging throughout the country and many horses and cattle can be found on the roads at night.\nTraffic Laws:  You must obey all local traffic laws. Passengers must wear seat belts and motorcycle riders must wear helmets. \nDrunk driving and hit-and-run accidents are significant problems. \nDrivers often speed on the newly upgraded roads that connect main cities and towns. \nMany local drivers do not stop at red lights, pass vehicles when it is dangerous or prohibited to do so, drive into oncoming traffic, and do not stop for pedestrians. \nTraffic police have been known to demand payment of arbitrary \"fines\" for purported infractions. Payment of traffic fines should be made at local banks. Some police vehicles now offer terminals for individuals with bank cards to pay their fines immediately. \nInternational driving permits are recognized in the Kyrgyz Republic. \nPublic Transportation : Buses tend to be very crowded and can be unsafe and unreliable. \nU.S. Embassy personnel are restricted from utilizing public transportation due to the potential for crime, sexual harassment, and assault. \nAvoid using \"private taxis\" and unmarked taxis or entering a cab that already contains passengers. \nTaxis ordered by telephone typically charge based on set rates; the driver’s cellular phone operates as the meter. \nIf hailing a taxi on the street, negotiate a fare prior to entering a cab. Cab drivers often try to charge foreigners a higher fare. Many taxi services now have cabs equipped with meters, but passengers should confirm that they are functional before entering the cab. \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the Kyrgyz Republic’s  Department of Tourism Website  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in the Kyrgyz Republic, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information\nPolice and legal system bribes and informal procedures:  It is common for police to target foreigners to pay bribes for alleged traffic offenses. The Embassy is not usually able to provide assistance in these cases.

Hospitals in Thailand and Laos require large deposits prior to treating patients. The State Department does not pay medical bills.\nBorder Crossing Hours:  All of the land border crossings between Laos and neighboring countries close during the night hours.   The Friendship Bridge that connects Vientiane to Nong Khai, Thailand, closes from 10 p.m. – 6 a.m. daily.  While it is generally possible for ambulances to cross the Vientiane Friendship Bridge after hours, it sometimes takes several hours to arrange for the crossing to be opened, even in cases of severe medical emergencies.  Travelers should inquire locally about the hours of other border crossings . \nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.

Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Lebanon. ISIS and affiliated groups have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in lebanon. U.S. citizens have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon. The threat of anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to bystanders. Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements continue to occur in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions.  Even in the wake of the most recent conflict between Hizballah and Israel, Hizballah maintains a strong presence in the Bekaa Valley, in addition to areas in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. In addition to the threat of Hizballah-conducted terrorist activity, Hizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the Assad regime in Syria.\nAvoid the Lebanon-Syria border region:  The U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region because of past clashes, extremist activity, and the potential for these to recur at any time.\nAvoid the Lebanon-Israel border region, Beirut’s Dahieh suburb, and the Bekaa valley:  Since October 2023, the Israel-Lebanon border region has seen continuous, intense exchanges of fire between Israel and Hizballah along the Blue Line (a line separating   Israel from Lebanon and the Golan Heights), which has killed and injured civilians caught in the crossfire. In September 2024, Israel intensified its air campaign against Hizballah throughout the country, to include the Dahieh suburb of Beirut and the Bekaa valley,   as well as initiating a limited ground operation in South Lebanon that have killed and injured civilians, including women, children, journalists, medical workers, and first responders   Israel and Lebanon announced a cessation of hostilities in November 2024 to be followed by a 60-day implementation period of Israeli withdrawal and Lebanese deployment. The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to avoid in particular Beirut’s Dahieh suburb, the Bekaa valley, areas south of the Litani River, and especially the Lebanon-Israel border area. Travelers should watch for posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all marked areas.\nAvoid travel to refugee settlements:   Violence within refugee settlements has resulted in shootings and explosions. U.S. citizens should avoid travel to refugee settlements. Palestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese government and the United States operate autonomously in formal and informal refugee settlements in different areas of the country.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:  Reported crime rates in Lebanon are moderate but rising. Violent crime and sexual assault are rare but do occur. Petty theft -- such as pickpocketing and purse snatching -- occurs in crowded public areas. More recently, the dire economic situation is engendering a significant increase in economically motivated crimes, including home invasions and car thefts. Police are responsive but often unable to affect a positive outcome.\nDemonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. Protests often occur spontaneously with little to no advance warning.\nInternational Financial Scams:  Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Lebanon. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.\nCommon scams include:\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes by visiting the nearest police or by calling the ISF hotline 1745 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(961) 4-542600 or +(961) 4-543600. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.  \nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Lebanon can be significant, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Visitors lacking passport or identification documents at government checkpoints are subject to questioning by Lebanese authorities. In certain areas, taking photos of buildings or other infrastructure has led to questioning and detention. In Lebanon, persons driving under the influence can be jailed immediately.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice website .\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nIndividuals who were affiliated with the former militia known as the South Lebanon Army (SLA) and previously departed Lebanon because of their association with that group should carefully consider any plans to return to Lebanon. Alleged former members of the SLA have been detained on arrival and received threats to their physical security, even after receiving assurances from Lebanese officials and/or legal counsel in Lebanon that they could return safely.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  LGB status and/or conduct is criminalized in Lebanon, and LGB persons can face significant social stigma. Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code prohibits sexual relations, “contradicting the laws of nature,” an offense punishable by up to one year in prison. Although Lebanese courts have interpreted this provision in different ways and prosecutions are rare, judicial decisions can vary case-to-case and LGB adults have been charged, tried, and convicted for engaging in consensual same-sex relations. Authorities have arrested LGB individuals for minor offenses, then charged them with violation of Article 534 when evidence of their LGB identity is uncovered, through searches of cell phones or other personal material. While prosecution is uncommon, short-term detentions can expose individuals to discrimination and abuse.\nThere has been a rise in anti-LGB rhetoric from political and religious leaders, accompanied by an increase in online harassment, threats of violence, and violence against LGB persons. In August 2023, members of an anti-LGB religious group attacked an LGB friendly establishment in the Mar Mikhael neighborhood of Beirut, reportedly threatening, assaulting, and injuring patrons. Gatherings, events, or items (including those with rainbows) perceived as “promoting homosexuality” have the potential of being scrutinized, monitored or disbanded by security forces.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information page  and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Lebanon prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is relatively low. Some facilities and information have been made accessible, but such standard accessibility is not common. Expect infrastructure accessibility to be limited in urban areas, and even more so in the rest of the country. There are a handful of hotels that are partially accessible in the Beirut area. Some transportation companies do provide accessible services. Events and activities are rarely designed to be inclusive.\nService providers for people with disabilities, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, are available but limited in Lebanon. The best way to find assistance is to contact organizations for people with disabilities such as the Lebanese Union for Persons with Physical Disabilities, the Youth Association of the Blind, the Lebanese Federation of the Deaf, or the Lebanese Association for Self Advocacy.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nExit Bans:  U.S. citizens living in or traveling in Lebanon are sometimes denied permission to depart the country because a criminal, civil, or family court has imposed an exit ban. For example, a head of household can place an exit ban against a spouse and children even before the family arrives in Lebanon. Easily initiated, exit bans remain in place for prolonged periods and can only be removed by petition from an attorney. The U.S. Embassy cannot have exit bans removed, even in times of crisis. An attorney’s list is available on  U.S. Embassy Beirut’s website .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nDual Citizenship:  U.S. citizens who also hold Lebanese nationality are considered by local authorities to be Lebanese, even when entering Lebanon using a U.S. passport. Lebanese-U.S. citizens who are suspected of association with Israeli citizens or officials, or to have traveled through Israel, are subject to detention, arrest, and prosecution. Their passports may be retained by Lebanese authorities on arrival, and they must appear at the Lebanese Military court the next business day for investigation, after which their passports may be returned if no connections with Israel are confirmed. U.S. citizen dual nationals of other Arab countries who arrive at a Lebanese point of entry with an Israeli stamp in their passports will be denied entry and may be detained or arrested. Travelers with a family name deemed to be of Israeli or Jewish origin may also be questioned or detained.\nTravelers who have previously entered Lebanon illegally under Lebanese law, whether as refugees or for transit to a third country, may be denied entry, even if they are or have since become U.S. citizens.\nMiddle Eastern Heritage:  U.S. citizens with names reflecting Middle Eastern heritage may face additional scrutiny at Lebanese ports of entry and may be required to show documentary evidence of their parentage: specifically, official proof of their father’s name such as a copy of their birth certificate.\nMarrying in Lebanon:  More than 18 separate and distinct religious sects solemnize marriages in Lebanon. Civil marriage is not available. U.S. citizen and Lebanese national couples should familiarize themselves with the rights and responsibilities of marriage as defined by the religion performing their marriage. They should be aware that religious clerics and religious courts dictate all personal status matters related to marriage, divorce, and child custody. In matters of marriage, child custody, inheritance, and divorce, personal status laws provide unequal treatment across the various confessional court systems but generally discriminate against women.  Nationality law also discriminates against women, who may not confer citizenship to their spouses and children. Civil marriages performed outside of Lebanon and registered with Lebanon’s Ministry of the Interior fall under civil court jurisdiction regarding divorce and child custody.\nMilitary Service Obligation:  Mandatory military service in Lebanon was abolished in 2007. However, travelers with questions about prior military service, desertion, or failure to register in the past should contact the  Embassy of Lebanon in Washington, D.C.  for details prior to traveling to Lebanon.\nCustoms:  Lebanese customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning import and export of items, such as firearms, military paraphernalia, professional camera equipment, other communications equipment, or antiquities. You should contact the Embassy of Lebanon in Washington, D.C., for specific information regarding customs requirements. Please see our information on  customs regulations .\nFor emergency services in Lebanon dial 112.\nAmbulance services are:\nWe do not pay the medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Lebanon Ministry of Health  to ensure the medication is legal in Lebanon.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nWater Quality:  In all areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe.\nHealth facilities in general:\nPharmaceuticals      \nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States.  In certain areas, pedestrians have minimal access to sidewalks and are forced to walk along the sides of busy roadways.  There are very few bicycle lanes designated for cyclists, and drivers are unaccustomed to sharing the road with cyclists.  Beirut streets and highway lanes are known for their heavy traffic congestion and aggressive driving.  Lanes are generally unmarked, and roads outside the capital may be poorly lighted.\nDrivers generally will find inter-city directional signs and street markers, but side roads often are unmarked.An international driver’s license is required for visitors to Lebanon. \nTraffic Laws:\nA  comprehensive listing of Lebanese traffic laws  (in Arabic) is available on the website of the Lebanese  Internal Security Forces (ISF).\nPublic Transportation:  In general, public transportation in Lebanon is safe and buses operate throughout the country.  Taxis are widely available and rideshare services are also active in Lebanon.  \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Lebanon’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight.  FAA’s  website  includes more information on its assessment program.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of the Damascus Flight Information Region (FIR). The FAA advises caution for flights operating in the airspace within 200 nautical miles of the Damascus FIR due to heightened military activity in or around Syria.  \nFor more information, U.S. citizens should consult the  Federal Aviation Administration's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices .\nMaritime Travel: Mariners planning travel to Lebanon should also check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts .  Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings .\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has concerns about the safety practices in the ports of Lebanon.  Until those concerns can be addressed, the U.S. Coast Guard advises that Mariners and passengers traveling through the ports of Lebanon should exercise caution.

Visas are not required for U.S. citizens visiting for 180 days or fewer. U.S. citizens are generally granted 30 days at a border and may apply for an extension up to 180 days through the Office of Immigration at the Ministry of Home Affairs.  For stays longer than 180 days, U.S. citizens are required to apply for a residence permit at the  Ministry of Home Affairs . Lesotho government websites are often outdated so best to directly contact the Immigration Office. Vaccination for yellow fever is a common requirement throughout the region. You should carry your international vaccination cards with you. For more information concerning entry requirements, travelers may contact the Embassy of the Kingdom of Lesotho, 2511 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20008, tel. (202) 797-5533. \nAttention new South Africa Regulations:  \n  Travelers must have two blank (unstamped) visa pages to visit or transfer through South Africa. You must also carry unabridged birth certificates for all children under 18. Please see  Country Specific Information for South Africa  for additional information.\nU.S. citizens normally do not need a visa for South Africa if you plan to stay less than 90 days. However, South African visa requirements are different for individuals who are residents of Lesotho. It is common for foreigners residing in Lesotho to receive seven-day visas when crossing into South Africa by road. Travelers who overstay in South Africa may be declared “undesirable” by the immigration authorities. They will then be barred from entering South Africa. Travelers planning to visit South Africa for a longer period should check with the  High Commission of South Africa in Maseru  on how to obtain a visa for a longer stay.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Lesotho.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:   Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.  Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds.  Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: \nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page. \n Demonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nCrime:  Lesotho has a high crime rate, and foreigners must remain vigilant at all times. Foreigners are frequently targeted and robbed and have been car-jacked and killed. U.S. citizens have reported incidents – including sexual assault, armed and unarmed confrontation, and home invasion – occurring in broad daylight. There are no indications that U.S. citizens are specifically targeted.\nCrime is most prevalent in urban areas but can happen anywhere. Criminal incidents have occurred in popular restaurants, along poorly lit or unlit roads, and at locations frequented by foreigners. Victims have included tourists, volunteer workers, and employees of non-governmental organizations.\nExtra caution should be exercised while walking through downtown Maseru, both at night and during the day. You are urged to exercise caution and avoid crowds, demonstrations, or any other form of public gathering. Traveling alone or at night is particularly dangerous due to limited street lighting and undeveloped road conditions. \nThere is a serious problem with theft from baggage at O.R. Tambo International Airport (Johannesburg). It is a required transit point for air travel to Lesotho. You should secure your luggage with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) approved locks, use an airport plastic wrapping service, and avoid placing any items of value in checked luggage. Make an inventory of items in checked baggage to aid in claims processing if theft does occur.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Lesotho. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:    \nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobile Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad are keeping all software (operating system and apps) updated and use virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. \nGPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration. \nBe cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. \nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nExtreme weather preparation:  Visitors to the interior of Lesotho should bring clothing and equipment suitable for extreme cold weather during the winter months of June through August. Weather conditions can deteriorate rapidly in the mountains, and snow may close mountain passes. Temperatures can drop below freezing even in the lowlands.\nLesotho has one of the highest rates of lightning strikes per square mile in the world, and lightning-related deaths are not uncommon. If you find yourself in a storm, find shelter in a building or car.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or must give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.\nSee the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website  and  U.S. Department of Justice  website for more information.\nFaith-based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nInternational Volunteers:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual relations between men are criminalized in Lesotho, although the U.S. Embassy is not aware of any recent arrests or prosecutions. There is no explicit prohibition of consensual same-sex sexual relations between women.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  The Buildings Control Act of 1995 requires that all buildings be made accessible, but enforcement thus far has been negligible. There are no mandatory standards of accessibility for sidewalks, road crossings, public transportation, and parking areas. There are no free or reduced fares for transport, and very few accessible places of lodging, medical facilities, restaurants, cafes, or bars.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The Persons with Disability Equity Act, 2021 in Lesotho prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, visual, intellectual, or mental disabilities, and the law is partly enforced. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.  Increasingly new public and private facilities in the capital city and in Leribe and Berea districts are partially accessible.   \nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .   \nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers . The rate of gender-based violence is Lesotho is extremely high. Women should remain vigilant when traveling in Lesotho and should avoid traveling alone if possible.\nThere are no adequate health facilities in Lesotho and ambulance service is unreliable. High-quality care is available in Bloemfontein, South Africa, 90 miles away. U.S. Embassy Maseru maintains a list of  physicians and other health care professionals , but does not guarantee service or provide recommendations.\nVitality Ambulence can be used for emergency services.  \n Dial Landline:  +266 22326690   \nCell: +266 80012121/+266 5834 9286.  \n Contact Person:  Dr. Malebohang Raleche\nAmbulance services are:\nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  Travelers’ Health webpage  and general  Traveler Advice  for Lesotho.   \nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies ,  and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.  \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . \nVisit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.  \nThe Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. If traveling with prescription medication, check with the government of Lesotho, and its  Ministry of Foreign Affairs  to ensure the medication is legal in Lesotho. Always carry an adequate supply of your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. \nLesotho has one of the highest HIV rates in the world. Approximately one-quarter of the adult population of Lesotho infected with HIV. Travelers are advised to practice safe sex if engaging in sexual activity, or if exposed to blood products through injuries or rendering assistance to accident victims. \nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nFurther health information: \nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of  doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nHealth facilities in general:\nPharmaceuticals:  Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescription in the United States, are often readily available for purchase with little controls.  Counterfeit  and substandard medication is common and may prove to be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. \nPlease visit the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and the  Food and Drug Administration  websites for more information.\nNon-Traditional Medicine:  U.S. citizens have suffered serious complications or died while seeking medical care from non-traditional “healers” and practitioners in Lesotho. Ensure you have access to licensed emergency medical facilities in such cases.\nWater Quality:  In Maseru, tap water is potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\nAltitude:  Many cities in Lesotho are at high altitude. Beware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Travel to High Altitudes .\nGeneral Health:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  The majority of Lesotho’s 5,000 miles of roads remain unpaved. A few main rural highways are comparable to U.S. two-lane rural roads, but lane markings, signs, shoulders, and guardrails do not meet U.S. standards. Lesotho's mountainous terrain makes driving on secondary roads hazardous. Road accidents are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Lesotho. Unpaved roads in the interior—often narrow, winding, and steep—are poorly maintained. For travel in the interior, especially in wet or snowy weather, a high ground clearance or four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended. Four-wheel-drive is also a requirement for entering or departing Lesotho through the Sani Pass on the eastern border. The authority for road safety issues rests with the  Lesotho Mounted Police Service ; there are no auto clubs or reliable ambulance services. Drivers should contact the police in case of road emergencies.\nTraffic Laws:  Traffic moves on the left, with right-hand drive vehicles. Never assume right-of-way, as aggressive and unpredictable local driving habits result in frequent collisions. Lesotho has a high number of traffic-related deaths and injuries. Driving after dark is dangerous due to the absence of street lighting, livestock on the roads, and the prevalence of crime—including incidents of carjacking. Travel is best done by private car. Rental cars are available in Maseru. Cars rented in neighboring South Africa may be brought into Lesotho with the written permission of the rental company.\nPublic Transportation:  Although bus and public taxi services exist, chronic overloading combined with inadequate vehicle maintenance and lack of driver training make them unsafe. Some private taxi services are available in the capital, but roving mini-bus taxis should be avoided. There is no passenger train service in Lesotho.\nSee the  Ministry of Transport’s facebook  page for more information.\nVisit the website of Lesotho’s National  Tourist Office  authority responsible for road safety. \nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Lesotho, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Lesotho’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page ."

See Traveler’s Protocol at  http://moh.gov.lr/\nRequirements for Entry:\nIf you do not obtain a Liberian visa prior to arrival, you may be deported immediately. Visit the  Embassy of Liberia  website for the most current visa information.\nSums in excess of $10,000 USD must be reported at the port of entry, and no more than $7,500 USD in foreign currency banknotes can be moved out of the country at one time. Larger sums must be transferred via bank drafts or other financial instruments.\nExpect strict enforcement of border controls, and occasional border crossing closings, by Liberian, Ivorian, Sierra Leonean, and Guinean authorities. Corruption has been reported at many border locations and you may be asked for money prior to crossing the border. Some travelers have found that asking for official signed receipts for the payment of any unexpected “fines” can deter requests for bribes.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Liberia.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nLiberia's police force has limited resources. The Liberia National Police have a strong presence in Monrovia, but less of a presence outside of the capital city. The police can be both a source of assistance and a source of problems for visitors. Travelers may be detained by police officers soliciting bribes. You are encouraged to carry a photocopy of your passport with you at all times as proof of identity and citizenship. If detained or arrested, you should ask to contact the U.S. Embassy immediately.\nYou should be aware of your surroundings at all times and use caution when moving around, especially at night. Travel outside of Monrovia after dark is strongly discouraged, as roads are in poor condition and there are few public street lights. U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital or between counties after dark (with the exception of travel to and from Roberts International Airport).\nAvoid crowds, political rallies, and street demonstrations, and maintain security awareness.\nCrime:  Crimes of opportunity, such as residential burglary or armed robbery (typically using a knife or machete) have affected U.S. citizens and are more common at night. Criminal activity has been reported in both urban and rural areas, including public beaches. The Liberia National Police have limited capacity to respond to crime events.\nThe local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Liberia is also 911. However, emergency services are not provided reliably or consistently. Also, there is no landline telephone service in Liberia, and cellular phone communication is subject to occasional disruptions in service. A call to 911 in Liberia may go unanswered, and you should employ other resources to obtain emergency assistance.\nCorruption:  Corruption is rampant. Poorly paid government officials and private company employees may ask for “fees” for doing their job, and travelers may be inconvenienced for not paying bribes. Requesting official signed receipts for the payment of any unexpected “fines” or “fees” can sometimes deter such improper behavior.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nScams:  Internet romance and financial scams occur in Liberia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should seek medical assistance as needed and contact the U.S. Embassy as soon as possible. \nReport crimes to the local police in person or at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (231) 77-677-7000.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance as many medical procedures are not available in Liberia. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Liberia are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\nFurthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nPhotographs:  Photographing military installations, air and sea ports, and important government buildings is prohibited. You should not take photographs of sites or activities that may be considered sensitive, as police may confiscate the camera.\nInfrastructure:  Lodging, fuel, transportation, utilities, and telephone services are not consistently available, especially outside of Monrovia. Hotel rooms can be difficult to find without an advance reservation. There is no working landline telephone system in Liberia. You should rent or purchase a local cellular phone. Commercial air courier service is available.\nFinancial Issues:  The Liberian dollar is the official currency; however, the U.S. dollar is accepted as legal tender. Liberian dollars are preferred for smaller purchases, especially outside of Monrovia. Wire transfers may be limited and subject to fees if you do not have a Liberian bank account. ATMs are not widely available. Due to a cash shortage in Liberia’s banking sector, it is difficult to obtain adequate cash supplies – both Liberian and U.S. dollars – from ATMs and banks. Traveler's checks and credit cards are not regularly accepted, except at some major hotels in Monrovia. There have been some reports of financial information being compromised even at hotels where credit cards are routinely accepted; always keep your credit card in sight.\nSwimming Hazards:  Do not swim alone or after dark and do not walk on any beach after dark. Travelers should seek out and heed posted warnings and refrain from bathing at unmarked, unpatrolled beaches.\nDo not swim in the Atlantic Ocean if you are unfamiliar with swimming in water where very strong rip currents occur. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast. The Liberia Weather Service does not provide information on where and when these tides form, and there are no lifeguards posted on beaches. In some areas, the water may be contaminated with sewage.\nAvoid use of alcohol or mind-altering drugs while engaging in water sports. Avoid water where sewage contamination or algae are present. Avoid any exposure (rafting, swimming, or wading) in water known to be infected with schistosomiasis (bilharzia).\nScuba dive only with personnel certified by the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) or the National Associated of Underwater Instructors (NAUI); use equipment only from PADI- or NAUI-certified dive operators. Follow established timetables for air travel after diving. The time from the end of the dive until the boarding of an aircraft is generally between 12 and 24 hours, depending on the type of dive.\nDecline water transportation in vessels without personal flotation devices or life jackets.\nWear appropriate footwear when walking, wading, or swimming to avoid injury and exposure to parasites and poisonous plants and animals.\nRisk from jellyfish exists, including highly venomous Portuguese man-of-war. Travelers wading, launching boats, or fishing are especially at risk. Risk from coral, stonefish, and sea urchins exists.\nSit on a towel, blanket, or piece of clothing if a chair or hammock is not available because sand may be contaminated in areas frequented by animals. Thoroughly shake out all fabrics after use.\nAvoid eating amberjack, bonito, mackerel, mahi-mahi, or tuna due to risk of scombroid poisoning. Low risk of ciguatera poisoning exists in coastal areas and is presumed to have widespread distribution. Travelers should also avoid consumption of reef fish such as amberjack, barracuda, grouper, and snapper. The toxin remains even when these fish are well cooked.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Liberia. Voluntary sodomy is a first-degree misdemeanor with penalties ranging up to one year in prison.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Liberia prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced to the extent possible. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is reported as comparable to the United States due to the visibility of people who are living with injuries sustained in the civil wars or from polio. Expect accessibility to be limited or nonexistent in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\nIndividuals may be able to purchase second-hand equipment from street markets. Durable medical equipment stores do not exist in Liberia; therefore, anyone who needs equipment or devices should bring them to Liberia. Liberia does not provide hearing aids or repair of hearing aids. Services such as sign language are very limited and only available in Monrovia. Additionally, Liberia does not have an agency that trains or staffs personal assistants for those with disabilities. Individuals needing a personal care assistant would need to hire and train the personal care assistant.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Rape is a crime in Liberia punishable by up to life in prison. However, the Liberian government does not effectively enforce the law, and rape is a serious and pervasive problem. Domestic violence also remains a serious problem despite being punishable by up to six months in prison.\nAlthough female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) was banned by a proclamation of the National Council of Chiefs and Elders in 2023, it is not specifically against the law in Liberia.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nHospitals and medical facilities in Liberia are poorly equipped and are incapable of providing many services. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. For serious medical problems, you should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment. Within Liberia, medicines are scarce, often beyond expiration dates, possibly counterfeit, and generally unavailable in most areas.\nMalaria and yellow fever are prevalent throughout the country. Yellow fever immunization is required to enter Liberia and recommended for all residents. Chemoprophylaxis (anti-malarial medication) is recommended for all travelers, even for short stays. \nYou should:\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . \nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the  government of Liberia  to ensure the medication is legal in Liberia. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. \nThe following diseases and medical hazards are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Expect time-consuming detours around the many bridges and roads damaged by war, neglect, or the heavy annual rains occurring between May and November. Traffic accidents are frequent and often result in injury or loss of life. Approach intersections with extreme caution. Potholes and poor road surfaces are common. Vehicles are often overloaded with people and goods, and make frequent stops without signaling. Drivers overtake on the right and left lanes. Many vehicles operate with threadbare tires, and blowouts are frequent.\nTraffic Laws:  Drivers in Liberia are expected to hold either a Liberian or an international driver’s license; a driver’s license from your home country will not be sufficient. At the same time, traffic laws are either nonexistent or not enforced. You are required to pull off the road to make way for high-speed car convoys carrying government officials. Be aware that mob violence is not uncommon if you are involved in a traffic accident. If you are involved in an accident, unless it is physically unsafe to remain in your vehicle, it is often safest to stay in your locked car and call for assistance immediately.\nPublic Transportation:  Public taxis are poorly maintained and usually overloaded. Taxis have been occasionally targeted for robbery. If you must travel as a passenger, it is best to ask a trusted friend to drive you in his or her personal vehicle and to travel with all doors locked and all windows rolled up. Public buses are crowded and may make you vulnerable to pick-pockets or robbers. Three-wheeled “kekes” (motorized rickshaws) are extremely dangerous and should be avoided.\nFor more information, please visit our  Road Safety  page. Visit the website of Liberia’s national tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Liberia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Liberia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .The Embassy has information indicating that airport safety, security, maintenance, training, and emergency response-capabilities in Liberia fall below international standards.\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Liberia should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport  website, and the  NGA broadcast warnings website ."

Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Tunis for assistance. Victims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system.\nVictims may wish to report crimes to the local police station closest to where they are residing and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(216) 71-107-000, or +216 29 980 978 for WhatsApp calling capabilities.

See our  webpage  for further information.\nIf you are detained in Libya, the Department of State may not be notified of your detention, and Department of State officials cannot visit you, due to security reasons throughout the country and the suspended operating status of the U.S. Embassy in Libya.  Since most law enforcement is currently performed by militias, there are few clear legal processes.  During your detention, you may not be provided with basic toiletries or appropriate nutrition.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods also may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.

Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad page  and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:\nWomen and girls in Libya, particularly those with relatives of Libyan origin, as well as other Western travelers, are at increased risk of forced marriage, abduction, and kidnapping in Libya.\nWomen travelling alone or with children, including Westerners and U.S. citizens, have been stopped, questioned, or harassed by authorities for travelling without a male guardian throughout Libya or when attempting to exit the country.  Male guardianship is not mandatory under current Libyan law, but Libyan authorities frequently require it.  Women and men travelling together may be asked to provide a marriage certificate to verify their relationship.\nEven when accompanied by a male guardian, women have been intimidated, threatened, and detained by armed militias, extremists, or other individuals for “un-Islamic” behavior.  Women are expected to wear clothing that meets strict modesty standards and may be stopped or harassed if they are dressed in a manner that is deemed immodest.  Women and girls who have been detained in Libya also report being victims of acts of sexual violence inflicted by authorities and/or militia members.\nVictims of sexual assault have little recourse in Libya, and women who report sexual crimes may be accused of adultery and are at risk of further violence against them if they are unable to prove that a crime occurred under a high standard of proof in the Libyan judicial system.\nFind more information about the specific risks that women face in Libya through our Libya  Travel Advisory , the  Country Security Report , and see our  travel tips  for women travelers.\nSee our  travel tips for Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in Libya, dial 1515.\nAmbulance services are:\nInjured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nHealth Facilities:\nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention’s entire  Travelers’ Health webpage  and general  Traveler Advice  for Libya.\nThe Department of State does not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.  Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nThe Department strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check with the  Embassy of Libya  to ensure the medication is legal in Libya.\nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals  here . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:    Roadside assistance is extremely limited and offered only in Arabic. Wind-blown sand can reduce visibility without warning. During rainstorms, roads will flood. Very few streets are marked or have signage, and highway signs are normally only in Arabic. Paved roads in rural areas are satisfactory; however, many rural roads are unpaved.\nTraffic Laws:  There is a high accident rate and traffic laws are rarely enforced.\nPublic Transportation:  Public transportation is limited.  Taxis are available, but taxi drivers may be reckless and untrained.  English-speaking drivers are extremely rare.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:\nWhile there are operational international airports in Libya with regular domestic and international flights, flights are often delayed, rerouted, and cancelled without warning.  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Libya, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Libya’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nThe FAA has issued a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) which prohibits U.S. civil aviation from flying into or over Libya.  Further information may be found on the FAA’s  Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices  webpage.\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Libya should also check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts at: https://www.maritime.dot.gov/  Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website,  and the  NGA broadcast warnings website.  Navigational warnings can be found under the “Current Warnings” section for the applicable NAVAREA from within the NGA site. Navigational warnings can be found under the “Current Warnings” section for the applicable NAVAREA from within the NGA site.\nPort Security:  The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Libyan ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Libya.  Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Libya should exercise increased caution."

The U.S. Embassy in Antananarivo cannot help you extend your visa.\nScreening for Ebola infection may be conducted at the airports.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Madagascar.\nMinor children:\nAccording to Malagasy law, residents of Madagascar with minor children traveling without both parents are required to have a notarized letter of consent to travel from the absent parent, preferably in French. This requirement does not apply to tourists visiting Madagascar. Please check neighboring countries’ country information for requirements for traveling with minor children.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs information  on our websites.\nSpecial Note:  Overseas departments and territories of France (e.g., Mayotte) are not included in the Schengen Agreement. See the  Embassy of France  website for further information.\nCivil unrest, such as protests, is common in Madagascar. Be especially vigilant in the vicinity of downtown Antananarivo especially near government buildings, the national stadium, and historical monuments, where violent incidents have occurred.\nViolent confrontations between the dahalo (criminal gangs that steal cattle) and security forces have increased in several regions of Madagascar, particularly in areas south and west of the capital.\nOften precipitated by rumors or allegations of injuries to local citizens especially in areas where there are minimal security forces, mob violence and “popular justice” continues but is rarely directed toward foreign nationals. Street altercations and traffic accidents often quickly draw large and sometimes unruly crowds. Exercise caution and remain calm if you find yourself in a dispute, particularly in a public place. If you feel threatened by large crowds, immediately leave the scene, seek the direct intervention of local law enforcement, and contact the U.S. Embassy.\nThe cyclone season in Madagascar occurs between December and April. Please monitor media reports, the  RSMC Tropical Cyclone Center , and follow all official instructions.\nExercise Increased Caution Due to Possible Protests and Civil Unrest Related to Presidential Election\nThe official campaign season for Madagascar’s presidential election has begun. The first round of voting is scheduled for November 16. A second round, if necessary, is scheduled for December 20. Opposition candidates have already called for and staged large-scale protests in the capital, Antananarivo, resulting in violent confrontations with law enforcement. Such protests may continue throughout the election period and may escalate and expand geographically as the candidates begin to campaign throughout the country. Given the increased possibility of protests and civil unrest, we urge U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution and enroll in STEP to ensure access to security alerts sent by the Embassy.\nWe also advise U.S. citizens that domestic flights in Madagascar are frequently subject to last-minute cancellations that can leave travelers stranded in remote areas without assistance. Tsaradia, Madagascar’s state-owned domestic airline, has a monopoly on domestic commercial flights and is notorious for last-minute cancellations and rescheduling, with no recourse for stranded travelers. Those who book Tsaradia flights through a third-party may not receive any advance notice of such cancellations and rescheduling. Regional airports in Madagascar receive little traffic and will close completely if the Tsaradia flight(s) for the day is cancelled. In such an event, there are no airline personnel present to assist stranded travelers. We recommend that travelers make contingency plans for lodging and local transportation in case their flight is cancelled or rescheduled at the last minute.\nCRIME:  Petty crime in Madagascar is common in urban areas. Skilled pickpockets are very active in downtown Antananarivo, and they primarily target jewelry, purses, and mobile phones. Additionally, criminals have stolen luggage from baggage claim areas at Antananarivo’s Ivato International Airport by simply grabbing items off the conveyor belt and exiting the airport.\nSerious crimes, including home invasions, armed attacks, robberies, and assaults, are common in Madagascar. U.S. Embassy personnel are instructed not to use  taxi-bes  (minibuses which operate within urban centers) and  taxi-brousses  (which travel to outlying regions) due to the risk of carjacking and highway robbery. The majority of reported crimes were directed at Malagasy nationals but Westerners have likewise been targeted.\nViolent crime, such as armed robbery and assaults, is common in:\nVisiting remote sites:  While the government has increased the number of dedicated police units at popular tourist sites, only visit remote sites in large groups guided by reputable tour operators.\nExercise caution when traveling through these designated areas due to violent highway robberies:\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:\nReport crimes to the local police at 117, 22-227-35, or 22-357-09/10. U.S. citizens can also call the U.S. Embassy at (261) 20-23-480-00 if assistance is needed in communicating with law enforcement officials.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism : The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nDrugs:  Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Madagascar are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\nVisa overstays  are a violation of local laws and U.S. citizens who overstay their visas will be subject to fines and potential prosecution.\nExporting Gemstones/Precious Materials:  The Government of Madagascar restricts the export of precious gems. Before purchasing or transporting gemstones, seek clarification of the applicable laws. Any precious materials should be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity and a certificate to allow for exportation from Madagascar.\nCurrency:  Madagascar is primarily a cash economy. Although some high-end establishments accept credit cards (normally only Visa-network cards), most shops and restaurants are cash only.\nAlthough the government changed the local currency from the Malagasy franc (FMG) to the ariary in 2005, many Malagasy still think in terms of FMG. When discussing prices, you should quantify whether the price is in ariary or FMG (1 Ariary = 5 FMG). ATMs, which generally accept Visa-network cards only, are available in large cities. Dollars are not widely accepted, and $100 bills are frequently refused at banks and local businesses.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Madagascar with and between persons under the age of 21, and Malagasy law contains no anti-discrimination protections for LGB persons. Penalties can include imprisonment and fines.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  There is ample public transportation, but entering and exiting vehicles is precarious, and they are not equipped to accommodate passengers with disabilities. Vehicles are often still in motion as passengers enter and exit. There are no sidewalks in the vast majority of the country, and the roads are hazardous for foot travel with swerving vehicles and uneven surfaces. There are no pedestrian crossing signs or designated pathways, and crossing any street involves an element of risk. Pedestrian injuries are common. Public spaces are not wheelchair-accessible.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nConsult the  CDC website for Madagascar  prior to travel. \n\nPlague is endemic on the island, where outbreaks have resurfaced nearly every year since 1980. U.S. citizens visiting Madagascar are urged to monitor public health announcements from the Ministry of Public Health and the World Health Organization, and to follow public health guidelines and recommendations. Plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics, but it is crucial to seek medical treatment immediately, if you experience any plague signs or symptoms.\nSee the  List of Health Care Providers  on the Embassy Antananarivo web page.\nYou are responsible for all medical costs.  U.S. Medicare does not cover you overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  If your health insurance plan does not provide coverage overseas, we strongly recommend  supplemental medical insurance and medical evacuation plans .\nCarry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions range from minimally acceptable to very poor. There are few pedestrian crosswalks and no working traffic signals.\nU.S. Embassy personnel are prohibited from driving outside of major cities after dark. Certain roads in Antananarivo have restrictions on tractor trailers during the day, so trucks use the roads at night and do not always follow the traffic rules. Street lighting is limited, and it is difficult to see pedestrians, carts, and livestock. Additional risks include excessive speeding and drivers that do not use headlights\nThere are random police vehicle checkpoints throughout Madagascar, so carry photo identification (residency card, U.S. passport) in the event of police questioning. These checkpoints are routine in nature and should not result in vehicle and/or person searches as long as valid identification and visas are shown. However, travelers have reported harassment and bribe solicitation.\nIf you are stopped at a checkpoint:\nPlease note:\nPublic Transportation:  Public transportation is unreliable and vehicles are poorly maintained. Rail services are extremely limited and unreliable.\nDomestic and international air services operate regularly but are subject to delays and occasional breakdowns. Air Madagascar often changes in-country flight schedules based on demand; flights that are not full may be cancelled with little or no prior warning to passengers. Overbooking is also common. Reconfirmation of tickets prior to flight day is recommended, especially when flying from provincial airports.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. The Ministry of Public Works, telephone (20) 22-318-02, is responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Madagascar, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the Government of Madagascar’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA's safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Madagascar should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at the U.S. Department of Transportation’s  Maritime Security Communications with Industry WebPortal . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website  and as a broadcast warning on the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s website .\nPort Security:  The Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Madagascar ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Madagascar. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Madagascar should exercise increased caution."

Please note this number is not reliable and travelers should maintain back-up numbers, such as police and ambulance services, for the areas they visit. \nCrime : Crime is common in Malawi. Most crimes against U.S. citizens involve property. Residential break-ins are frequent; perpetrators are usually well armed and may become violent with little provocation. Petty street crime (robbery and pickpocketing) is common. There have been break-ins at hotels and lodges throughout the country. Kidnappings occur and non-Malawians have been targeted in Zomba.\nCarjackings occur, especially in Lilongwe and Blantyre. Carjackers often block the rear of a victim’s vehicle while it waits to pass through a security gate into a residence. Then, the assailants threaten the driver and take the car. Victims are often assaulted. Drivers are advised to lock their car doors, close their windows, and remain vigilant when entering or exiting a residence. When traveling, ensure your windows are up and doors are locked.\nYou should avoid traveling on foot at night, especially in urban areas, as armed muggings and assaults have occurred. Non-Malawians have been targeted in Lilongwe, and several U.S. citizens have been injured. City streets should be considered unsafe after dark even when walking in a large group. Pedestrians should also be cautious during daylight hours. Visitors in need of transportation should request that hotel or restaurant management call a taxi or car service.\nThe capacity and availability of public security forces is limited, we recommend you use caution when visiting and/or especially when staying in less populated areas such as the Mount Mulanje region. You should take appropriate action to ensure your safety if traveling to remote areas, and never travel alone or at night. Ensure you are communicating with a friend or family member as to your whereabouts while traveling in Malawi, as cell phone reception is limited in many areas.\nDemonstrations  frequently occur. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays or election dates, or during international events.\nGPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.\nBe cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nVictims of Crime:  You may report crimes to the local police at 199 or 997 and/or contact the U.S. Embassy at +265 (0)88 477 3166.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nWe can: \nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. \nSee our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nVisa Infractions:  U.S. citizens entering Malawi with tourist visas or visitor’s permits have been arrested, fined, and deported if found engaging in activities inconsistent with their tourist status, e.g., business or volunteer services.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. If you are able to contact a relative or friend, you should also ask them to contact the U.S. Embassy on your behalf.\nSee our  webpage  for further information.\nSpecial Circumstances:  Wild animals pose a threat to life and safety even in the most serene settings. Please observe local or park regulations and heed all instructions given by tour guides.  \nCredit cards are not commonly accepted outside of major cities. There are a limited number of ATMs in Malawi that accept Visa, MasterCard, and international ATM cards.\nDress codes prohibiting short skirts on women and long hair on men no longer exist. However, travelers should be aware that Malawi is a conservative society so be mindful of your dress, especially when visiting remote or rural areas. \nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.\nSee the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website  and  U.S. Department of Justice  website for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nInternational Volunteers:\nLGB Travelers:  LGB persons are denied, by law and practice, basic civil, political, social, and economic rights in Malawi. Consensual same-sex sexual activity is illegal and punishable by up to 14 years in prison, including hard labor. The penal code outlaws “unnatural offenses” and “indecent practices between males.” Same-sex sexual activity may also be prosecuted as “conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace.”  As of July 2014, the government has implemented a moratorium on the enforcement of laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual activity, though the general public largely remains hostile to LGB persons.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers With Disabilities:  The law in Malawi prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced consistently. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Some modern buildings may have wheelchair accessible entrances. Generally, public transportation is not accessible for travelers with disabilities. The Disability Act of 2013 prohibits discrimination in education, health care, social services, the workplace, housing, political life, and cultural and sporting activities for persons with disabilities. However, the government has yet to adopt standards and plans for its enforcement and implementation.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  The penal code criminalizes rape of women and girls with a maximum penalty of death for conviction. The 2015 Marriage, Divorce, and Family Relations Act explicitly introduced the concept of spousal rape, but the act does not prescribe specific penalties for conviction and applies only to legally separated spouses. Spousal rape may be prosecuted under the rape provisions of the penal code. The government generally enforces the law effectively, and convicted rapists routinely receive prison sentences. Data on the prevalance of rape or spousal rape, prosecutions, and convictions is unavailable; however, press reporting or rape and defilement arrests and convictions are an almost daily occurence. Although the maximum penalty for conviction of rape is death or life imprisonment, the courts generally impose lesser prison sentences.\nAlthough sexual harassment was believed to be widespread, there is no data on its prevalence or on the effectiveness of government enforcement of the law. The law makes conviction of sexual harassment punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment and places an obligation on government to have policies and procedures aimed at eliminating sexual harassment. Conviction of “insulting the modesty” of a woman is a misdemeanor punishable by one year’s incarceration. Conviction in extreme cases, such as indecent assault on a woman or girl is punishable by sentences of up to 14 years’ imprisonment.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers\nFor emergency services in Malawi, dial 998. Please note this number is not reliable and travelers should maintain back-up numbers, such as police and ambulance services, for the areas they visit. \nAmbulance services are not widely available. The training and availability of emergency responders are generally below U.S. standards. More information can be found  here . \nMedical facilities are rudimentary. While all health workers have some degree of English proficiency, communication can be difficult. Diarrhea and other food borne illnesses are a common problem. You should avoid tap water, ice cubes, and raw fruits and vegetables. Bottled water is recommended for drinking and food preparation. Consume only food that is well-cooked and served hot.\nMany medications are not available. You should bring adequate quantities of medications to last the duration of your stay. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. We encourage you to check with your primary healthcare provider or local travel clinic regarding malaria prophylaxis medications. \nFor major medical problems, you should consider obtaining medical treatment in South Africa, where advanced medical care is available. \nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  Travelers’ Health webpage  and general  Traveler Advice  for Malawi.\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nThe Department of State strongly recommends supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  The following diseases are prevalent:  \nTravelers should use the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended  mosquito repellents  and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.  Chemoprophylaxis  is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.\nHIV infection is endemic in the Malawian population. Travelers are advised to take appropriate precautions to limit the risk of transmission through blood or sexual contact.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals , available at https://mw.usembassy.gov/medical-assistance/. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nPharmaceuticals \nNon-Traditional Medicine \n  Water Quality \n  Adventure Travel\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Most roadways, except for major thoroughfares, are not paved, leading to accessibility problems during the November to April rainy season. Almost all roadways lack lighting at night. Most roads do not have sidewalks, forcing pedestrians and livestock to use the roadways both day and night. Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause of death among travelers to Malawi. Safety hazards include the lack of road shoulders, potholes, pedestrians, bicyclists, and livestock. You should drive defensively and avoid road travel outside cities at night.  Road support networks for stranded drivers do not exist. Fuel supply, both diesel and gasoline, is often erratic and travelers should plan accordingly. We do not recommend travel by foot along roadways.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nTraffic Laws:  Police roadblocks are common but properly documented drivers usually pass quickly and without incident. Malawian police operate radar-based speed traps throughout the country, and you are expected to pay fines on the spot—please ensure you get a receipt. Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. You should always wear a seat belt whenever available and insist drivers maintain a safe speed.\nPublic Transportation:  Visitors in need of transportation should request that hotel or restaurant management call a taxi or car service.\nAvoid public transportation, which is extremely limited and unreliable. Public transportation primarily consists of private citizens driving independently, and unregulated passenger vans in varying but generally poor states of condition and repair. These vehicles are frequently overburdened, and the drivers are inexperienced and untrained. In the cities, public transport includes bicycle taxis or small, motorized tricycles; each is unsafe. Modern coach buses are increasingly common on the main cross-country routes.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   Aviation concerns in Malawi have intensified following two plane crashes in 2024. In response to these incidents, authorities have faced growing pressure to modernize aviation infrastructure, adopt stricter safety regulations, and improve weather monitoring systems to prevent future accidents. As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Malawi, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Malawi’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. \nFurther information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page ."

You must have at least one blank page for the entry stamp. The Malaysian Immigration Department grants permission to enter and remain in the country. Visit the websites of the  Embassy of Malaysia in Washington D.C . or the  Malaysian Immigration Department  for more information. You do not need a Malaysian visa if you are coming for business or tourism for 90 days or less.\nUpon arrival, all travelers must complete the  Malaysian Digital Arrival Card (MDAC) . Permanent residents of Malaysia, long term-pass holders, and diplomatic and official passport holders are exempt from this requirement.\nFor the latest information, travelers should review the  Malaysian Immigration website . You can submit an  online inquiry form  or contact the Malaysian Government call center (MyGCC) at +60 3-8000-8000. If you are outside of Malaysia, contact the nearest Malaysian embassy or consulate for visa questions. \nOther countries in the region also require your passport have at least two blank pages or more and be valid for six months beyond entry. Please be sure to check your passport validity carefully before traveling.\nAt the border, officials will stamp your passport with a “social visit pass” (visa), allowing you to stay up to 90 days. You can apply to the Malaysian Immigration Department for extensions, and they are not guaranteed. You must exit Malaysia using the same passport that you used to enter. If you get a new passport while you are in Malaysia, you must apply for a special exit permit from Immigration authorities. This permit will go in your new passport and will be required to leave Malaysia.\nThe U.S. Government and the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur cannot help you apply for a Malaysian visa. We cannot advocate for your admission into Malaysia if you are denied entry.\nTravel Document : Travelers using a Refugee Travel Document (issued by USCIS) must get a visa before traveling to Malaysia. You may not arrive at the border in Malaysia without a visa. Contact your nearest Malaysian Embassy or Consulate to apply for a visa. \nBorder Crossings:   Follow all instructions for entering the country. Be sure your passport is stamped with the correct date when entering and exiting the country. Incorrect documentation or proof of entry into Malaysia can result in serious penalties. Be sure not to stay beyond your allowed time, usually 90 days for U.S. citizen tourists. \nAutogate:  U.S. citizens who registered for a Malaysia Digital Arrival Card can use the autogate at some Malaysian airports. The autogate lets travelers scan their passport and walk   through an automated gate for immigration clearance. U.S. citizens using the autogate will not get an entry stamp in their passport.  Sabah and Sarawak:  You must show your passport to enter or exit the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo. This is true even if you travel on a domestic flight to or from another part of Malaysia.\nDual Nationality:  Malaysia does not recognize or permit dual nationality. If local authorities learn you are a U.S.-Malaysian dual national, they may make you give up your U.S. passport or you risk losing your Malaysian citizenship. U.S.-Malaysian dual nationals should consider this seriously before traveling to Malaysia. See our  dual nationality page  for more information.\nU.S.-Israeli Dual Nationals:  Malaysia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel. U.S.-Israeli dual nationals have reported problems at Malaysian border control when showing their Israeli passports. U.S.-Israeli dual nationals should use their U.S. passports to depart the last country on their itinerary prior to arriving in Malaysia.\nVisa Overstays:  Malaysian immigration authorities take visa violations very seriously. They regularly fine and arrest foreigners who overstay their social visit passes (visas). Contact the Immigration Department of Malaysia if you overstay your visa. You will only be allowed to leave the country after resolving the overstay.\nCarry your passport with you at all times. Authorities may want to see the entry stamp in your passport to confirm you are in the country legally. If you entered Malaysia using an autogate and don't have an entry stamp, explain this to the local authorities you meet. U.S. citizens who cannot prove their nationality and legal status may be arrested. Be prepared to show your passport with a valid entry stamp. Detentions may last from a few hours to several weeks. Strictly follow immigration laws and regulations while in Malaysia. Check your visa status regularly while in the country.\nVisit the Embassy of Malaysia  website  for the most current visa information.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to Malaysia. This is also true for foreign residents of Malaysia.\nFor information about  international child abduction  and  customs regulations , please visit our website.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and copycat organizations aspire to attack U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists often use knives, firearms, and vehicles to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nMalaysia remains a transit point and, to a lesser extent, a destination country for members of terrorist groups. Information from credible sources suggests that there is a continued risk of armed terrorist and criminal groups operating and planning attacks against foreigners, including U.S. citizens, in the East Asian and Pacific region, including Malaysia.\nUse caution in eastern Sabah. Dangers include kidnappings-for-ransom, criminal violence, and terrorist activities. Criminal or terrorist groups may target tourist resorts or attack boats carrying tourists.\nDue to safety concerns, U.S. government employees may not travel to eastern Sabah in most circumstances. They may travel to the following areas with some restrictions: the cities of Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Tawau, the Sepilok Nature Reserve, and the Kinabatangan River areas. “Eastern Sabah” is considered everything east of the north-south line drawn from the cities of Kudat to Tawau, including all islands.\nDue to the security situation, there are dusk-till-dawn curfews at sea in the coastal areas around Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna, Sandakan, Kinabatangan and Beluran. Check local media or ask local police for the most recent curfew information.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.  \nCrime:   Petty theft and crime in Kuala Lumpur continue to be concerns. The most common crimes are purse snatchings, pickpocketing, smash-and-grab thefts, and residential burglaries. These crimes are committed against locals and foreigners alike. Avoid wrapping purse straps around arms or shoulders to avoid injury. Violent and more serious crimes are less common. Taxi drivers in central Kuala Lumpur have perpetrated violent crimes against passengers. It is safer to use a ride-hailing app or book a taxi by phone rather than hailing a taxi on the street. This is particularly true after dark.\nCriminals sometimes rob motorists stuck in traffic or stopped at a light. Keep valuables out of sight while driving and remove them from the car when parked. Do not leave GPS devices on the windshield or dashboard.\nDemonstrations occur frequently.  They can occur due to political issues, on holidays, or during international events.  \nLocal law pertaining to peaceful assembly  prohibits  non-Malaysians from participating in public protests.\nInternational Financial Scams:   See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information. \nSophisticated internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Malaysia. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings or dating profiles. Sometimes they start with unsolicited emails, letters, text messages, or social media messages. Scammers frequently pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:  \nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police by calling 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +60 3-2168-5000. We encourage crime victims to obtain a police report from local authorities. For advice on how to file a police report, call the Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) Operations Center in Kuala Lumpur at +60 3-2115-9999 or 3-2266-2222. In some areas, there are small \"Tourist Police” stations. Staff at these Tourist Police stations are familiar with helping international visitors. Remember that only local officials have the authority to investigate and to prosecute a crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can: \nDomestic Violence:  If you are a U.S. citizen and a victim of domestic violence, contact the Embassy at +60 3-2168-5000. Local “One Stop Crisis Centers” are in all government hospitals. They offer medical care, temporary shelters, legal aid, and counseling. These services are available to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse.\nTourism:  Malaysia regularly checks safety standards across the tourism industry. Clear signs identify hazardous areas and activities. Professional staff are usually there to help with organized activities. Medical care is widely available throughout the country if you get hurt. In remote areas, particularly in the eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak, first responders may take longer to reach patients than in large cities.\nWe encourage U.S. citizens to get medical evacuation insurance. See our  webpage  for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You must follow local laws. If you break them, even by accident, you could be expelled, arrested, or jailed. Get information from local authorities before starting a business or job that requires additional permits or licenses.\nPenalties for using, having, or selling illegal drugs in Malaysia are much harsher than in the United States.

For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask the police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for more information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are common in many countries. However, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You will have to pay fines or give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  Customs and Border Protection  website for more information.\nCurrency:  Currency exchange and Western Union money transfers are easy to find. Credit cards are accepted throughout the country but be aware of the risk of fraud. If possible, make sure your credit card remains in your sight during every transaction. ATMs can be a safer way of obtaining local currency than a currency exchange or money transfer. However, PINs in Malaysia are six digits long. Some travelers have reported trouble using four-digit PINs at ATMs.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nFaith-Based Travel Information\nInternational Religious Freedom Report  – see country reports\nHuman Rights Report  – see country reports\nHajj Fact Sheet for Travelers\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\nLGB Travelers:  Malaysia’s laws make homosexual acts illegal. Punishments can be up to 20 years in prison and/or whipping. Police sometimes raid nightclubs and events that are popular with LGB travelers. Same-sex marriages and civil unions performed in other countries are not legally recognized. Some Malaysian states have Islamic Sharia laws that apply to male and female Muslims.

Visit our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers With Disabilities:  Malaysian law prohibits discrimination against people with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. However, the law is not always enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities is similar to the United States.

Newer lodging, communication/information, and newer public infrastructure may be more accessible. Accessibility is more limited in rural areas.\nMalaysia has an active NGO community focused on disability welfare and protection. They can provide information and help with employment services, assistive devices and equipment, chore services, companion-based services, day services, and support network for parents.\nSee our  Travelers with Disabilities  page.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nSexual Violence:  If you are a victim of sexual assault, go to the nearest major hospital right away. Public hospitals offer a “one-stop” response, including medical care, forensic testing, help filing a police report, legal assistance, counseling, and temporary shelter. Most private hospitals do not offer mental health or counseling services, but U.S. citizens might find better and faster care at private hospitals in Malaysia. However, if a victim of crime wants to take legal action against the perpetrator, they must visit a public hospital for forensic evidence collection.  See additional travel tips for  Women Travelers . \nFor emergency services in Malaysia, dial 999. When you call for emergency assistance, the dispatcher will connect you to a government hospital of their choice. To get emergency care at a private hospital in Malaysia, call that hospital's emergency hotline. Alternatively, you can arrange your own transportation to the hospital.\nAmbulance services are:\nThe Department of State, U.S. Embassies, and U.S. Consulates do not pay for medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance covers you overseas. Some care providers overseas only accept cash payments. All hospitals and clinics require payment prior to providing care to foreigners. See  our webpage  for information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  CDC  for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend getting  MEDEVAC insurance  to cover medical evacuation.

Check with the  Royal Malaysian Customs Department  to make sure the medication is legal in Malaysia.\nVaccinations:  Make sure you are up to date on all CDC-recommended  vaccines .\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nAir quality in Malaysia changes often and fluctuates with the seasons. It is usually the worst in the dry season from July to October because of large agricultural fires in the area. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: \nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nMedical Facilities and Services:\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\nPharmaceuticals\nAssisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy\nWater Quality\nIn many areas, tap water is not reliably safe to drink.

Medicine to prevent malaria is recommended for all travelers, even for short stays.\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for  Resources for Travelers  and on specific issues in Malaysia.  \nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road safety is a very serious safety concern in Malaysia. In 2023, about 600,000 traffic accidents occurred in Malaysia, resulting in 6,443 deaths. It is one of the most dangerous countries to drive in. The main cause of traffic accidents is undisciplined motorcycle and motor scooter operators. They make up nearly two-thirds of all traffic deaths. Motorcyclists often do not follow traffic laws and drive without considering their safety or that of others. Use turn signals well in advance to alert motorcycles when you are turning. \nTraffic jams are common in major cities because road construction has not kept up with the increase of vehicles. Multi-lane highways often narrow down into two-lane roads, causing congestion. Many streets are narrow and winding. Traffic is heavy during the morning and afternoon rush hours and slows down a lot when it rains. Monsoonal rains can quickly flood roads in low-lying areas.\nTraffic Laws:  Traffic in Malaysia moves on the opposite side of the road to the United States. Most vehicles have the steering wheel on the right side. By law, you must wear your seat belt in both the front and back and must not use your cell phone while driving (unless it is hands-free). Turning left at a red light is not allowed unless there is a sign that says it is. Always carry your passport or Malaysian identification card when driving.\nIf you are involved in a traffic accident:\nReports of road rage incidents, especially after midnight, are increasing. Avoid confrontational behavior if you are in an accident. If you are threatened, stay in your car and lock the doors. If you can, leave the scene and file a report with the local police within 24 hours.\nSobriety Checkpoints:  Laws against drinking and driving are strictly enforced. Violations carry serious penalties. Police operate sobriety checkpoints in many entertainment districts frequented by expatriates. At these checkpoints, all drivers must submit to alcohol breath tests. If you fail a breath test, you will be arrested.\nDriver’s License Requirements:  You can use an International Driving Permit (IDP) along with a valid U.S. license to drive in Malaysia. You must get the IDP outside of Malaysia. If your IDP or U.S. license has expired, you must obtain a local driver’s license. Some visa holders may be eligible for a process called “conversion” to get a local license. For information on this process, please contact the  Malaysian Ministry of Transportation . The Ministry of Transportation recommends engaging a local driving school to help with the paperwork. To obtain a local license, you also need a valid long-term visa or work permit.\nMany car rental agencies in Malaysia will rent vehicles for a short term to U.S. citizens with only a valid U.S. driver’s license. However, if you plan to drive in Malaysia, obtain an IDP before leaving the United States. For information on how to obtain an IDP, visit the  Driving Abroad  section of the Department of State website.\nPublic Transportation:  There have been fatal and other serious accidents involving long-distance tour buses in Malaysia, especially at night or in bad weather. If you plan to travel by bus, choose a reputable company, and avoid overnight routes.\nTaxis are metered, but many drivers refuse to use the meter and charge much higher rates, especially during peak hours, when it is raining, or when the destination is in a busy area. By regulation, metered fares go up by 50 percent between midnight and 6:00 a.m.; meters automatically show the higher fee during these hours. Many people prefer booking taxi or ride services through popular smartphone apps for convenience and clear pricing. If you are visiting Malaysia by cruise ship, use taxis or tour operators that have an official relationship with the cruise company.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has found that the government of Malaysia’s Civil Aviation Authority meets the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for overseeing Malaysia’s air carrier operations. For more information, visit the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Malaysia should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .  Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard “Homeport” website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings  website."

Pay attention to beach signage and marking, at a minimum observe what the local and expatriate visitors are wearing to have an idea of local customs.\n If you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you should call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the U.S. Embassy in Colombo (+94-11-202-8500). We can sometimes connect you with a non-governmental organization in the Maldives that may be able to provide assistance.\nSee our tips for  Women Travelers .\n \n \nFor emergency services in the Maldives, dial 102.\nAmbulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas except Malé/Hulhumalé.

The Maldives has good safety standards for land, sea, and air travel. Roads in Malé and on the airport island are brick and generally well-maintained, though congested. Dirt roads on resort islands are well-kept by the resorts. Transportation in Malé is either by foot, by bus, or by readily available taxis that charge a fixed fee for any single journey. Transportation between the airport and Malé is by vehicle or by a public ferry. Travel to nearby resort islands is usually by motorized water taxi, speedboat, or seaplane. Trans Maldivian and Maldivian Air Taxi provide charter seaplane service to outlying islands during daylight hours. Maldivian, Manta Air, and Villa Air run fixed-wing domestic service to some of the atolls with land runways during night hours as well.

Visas are not available upon arrival in Mali. You must obtain your visa in advance of travel to avoid excessive fees and unexpected potential travel restrictions imposed at the port-of-entry. Visit the  Embassy of Mali  website for the most current visa information.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Mali.\nFind information on  dual nationality,   prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nRead the Department of State’s  Travel Advisory for Mali  and  Worldwide Caution  before planning travel to Mali.\nLawlessness and Instability:  Mali faces significant security challenges. A disparate group of militias, bandits, politically motivated armed groups, and extremists exert influence in wide swathes of northern and central Mali. Malian state presence—including law enforcement, schools, and other public services—generally does not exist in those areas outside of major cities. The northern parts of the country continue to be plagued by insecurity due to terrorism and ongoing military operations, while  central Mali--in the Segou and Mopti Regions--is unstable due to violent intercommunal conflict, instigated by terrorist groups, and armed attacks.\nTerrorism:  Travelers should avoid travel outside of Bamako because of insecurity and ongoing military operations. Terrorist groups with varying degrees of allegiance to al-Qa'ida and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) operate in Mali and often pursue local agendas complementary to these global jihadist movements. Groups linked with al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which have merged under the banner of  Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin  (JNIM), remain active and routinely conduct attacks targeting international and Malian military forces. These groups have claimed responsibility for small arms and improvised explosive attacks, kidnappings, and other violent actions, including attacks on the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).\nFrench troops, in collaboration with Malian security forces, conduct counterterrorism operations that target extremist elements. However, these foreign forces’ presence is not sufficient to counter every threat. Attacks by violent Islamist extremist groups have spread beyond the traditional conflict zone in the north to the center and south of the country. The area along the border with Burkina Faso and some remote parts of southern Mali are increasingly under threat of attack.\nIn Bamako, hotels, restaurants, and other areas where Westerners congregate may be targeted by extremists. On June 18, 2017 terrorists attacked Hotel Kangaba, a popular destination for westerners and expatriates on the outskirts of Bamako, killing five civilians and one Malian first responder.  \nKidnapping:  The threat of kidnapping of Westerners by criminal or terrorist groups remains high throughout the region. Extortion and kidnapping for ransom are significant sources of financing for JNIM-affiliated groups. In one exchange in 2020, JNIM released four hostages, including a Malian politician and three Westerners, for the release of some 200 prisoners held by Malian authorities. JNIM had executed another Western hostage shortly before the exchange.\nTravel Restrictions for U.S. Government Employees:  U.S. government employees must seek permission before traveling outside of Bamako. They are also prohibited from using public transportation outside of Bamako. Although these restrictions do not apply to private U.S. citizens, you should take them into account when traveling in Mali.\nCivil Unrest:  Periodic street demonstrations occur throughout Mali. Although some are planned and peaceful, demonstrations can occur spontaneously and turn violent. The majority of these are contained by security forces, but U.S. citizens should avoid street demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Mali also has been subject to periodic coups, the most recent of which occurred in August 2020.\nCrime:  Criminal traffickers of all kinds operate throughout the Sahel and may respond violently if encountered. Violent crimes are frequent; U.S. citizens should maintain a vigilant posture in all urban areas. There has been a recent uptick in police harassment and violent crime such as armed robbery, armed carjacking, and assault in Bamako. There are sporadic reports of nighttime robberies occurring on the roads outside of the capital; tourists should not drive at night (See Travel & Transportation section).\nFor Your Safety:\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should first contact the U.S. Embassy.\nReport crimes to the local police at 80 00-11 25 (connection and response is not always reliable) and contact the U.S. Embassy during normal consular hours at (+223) 20 70 23 00, or after-hours at (+223) 66 75 28 60.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. However, response from local authorities and recourse for victims of crime is extremely limited. When you do interact with local police, always request a copy of the police report.\nDue to the vigilantism which often occurs when criminals are apprehended in Mali, it is best to avoid the large crowds that may gather at the scene of a crime, a vehicle accident, or any altercation.\nPlease see our information for victims of crime, including  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas , and possible  victim compensation programs  in the United States.\nThe U.S. Embassy can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Travelers may be detained for questioning if stopped by the police and unable to produce their passport or for taking pictures of certain buildings. Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol may lead to arrest. If you break local laws, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. The U.S. government cannot get you out of jail.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCultural Property:  Mali is a signatory to the Treaty on Cultural Property, which restricts exportation of Malian archeological objects, in particular those from the Niger River Valley. Visitors seeking to export any such property are required by Malian law to obtain an export authorization from the National Museum in Bamako. Contact the  Embassy of Mali  in Washington D.C. or the nearest Malian consulate for specific information regarding customs requirements. U.S. Customs and Border Protection may impose corresponding import restrictions in accordance with the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act.\nCurrency/Access to Funds:  Currency exchange facilities are slow and often use out-of-date exchange rates. There are several ATMs in Bamako that accept U.S. credit/debit cards, though they do not always function reliably. There are some ATMs outside of Bamako in Segou, Sikasso, Koutiala, Gao, and Mopti, though they are occasionally inoperable. Credit cards are accepted at the larger hotels, Banque Atlantique, a few travel agencies (for an extra fee), some grocery stores, and upscale restaurants. Cash advances from credit cards are available in Mali via Western Union. The U.S. Embassy is unable to provide currency exchange services for private U.S. citizens.\nPhotography:  Exercise caution when taking photographs in Mali. Photographing any official object, entity, or person is restricted. These restrictions include infrastructure, facilities, government buildings, and individuals. You should obtain explicit permission from the Malian government before photographing transportation facilities and government buildings. Taking a photograph without permission in any public area or around any of the above listed facilities often provokes a prompt response from security personnel or offends the people being photographed. Taking photos of the U.S. Embassy in Bamako is also prohibited.\nCommunication:  Communication infrastructure in Mali is of limited coverage, especially outside of major cities, but there is cellular phone coverage in Bamako. International telephone calls are expensive. Internet service providers offer service in many areas of Bamako, and fiberoptic service is available for a price.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Mali. Societal discrimination, however, is widespread. LGB individuals have experienced physical, psychological, and sexual violence, which society views as corrective punishment and police frequently refuse to intervene. Most LGB individuals isolate themselves and keep their sexual identity hidden.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:   There is no law protecting the rights of persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or in the provision of other state services, nor requiring accommodation and access to public facilities. No special accommodations or officially reduced fares or rates are available to persons with disabilities in public transportation or taxis, communications, lodging, medical facilities, restaurants, cafés, bars or other tourist spots. Foot paths and pedestrian-friendly road crossings are rare and generally inaccessible to persons with disabilities.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Domestic violence, including spousal abuse, is common. Although the law prohibits spousal abuse, it does not prohibit domestic violence. The minimum age to marry without parental consent is 16 for females and 18 for males. Girls may marry with parental consent at age 15 if a civil judge approves. However, child marriage remains a common practice.\nFemale genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is legal in Mali and widely practiced. The Government of Mali prohibits FGM/C in government-funded health care centers.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nMedical facilities are extremely limited, especially outside of Bamako. U.S.-standard care does not exist. Most U.S. medicines are unavailable; European medications are more easily found and can be obtained at pharmacies throughout Bamako.\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for travel in Mali.  \n \n Malaria prophylaxis:  Travelers should take prescription medicine before, during, and after your trip to prevent malaria. Your doctor can help you decide which medicine is right for you, and also talk to you about other steps you can take to prevent malaria. See the  CDC website  for more detailed information about malaria in Mali.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  We recommend that you exercise extreme caution when traveling by road. Travelers after dark on roads outside of urban centers are subject to attack by kidnappers and terrorists, and, more commonly, regular banditry, as roads are poorly lit or seldom traveled. Road travel between Gao, Kidal, and Menaka, and outside Timbuktu, should be avoided as they are common sites for improvised explosive devices (bombs) and ambushes by armed assailants.\nMali has paved roads leading from Bamako to most major cities in the south and east. During the rainy season from mid-June to mid-September, some unpaved roads may be impassable. Four-wheel drive vehicles with spare tires and emergency equipment are recommended. Professional roadside service is not available. It is imperative to carry sufficient quantities of drinking water and food. Drivers should ensure that their gas tanks are at least half-full at all times, as gas stations are not widely available.\nDrivers travel on the right-hand side of the road in Mali. Speed limits range from 40-60 km per hour (25-40 miles per hour) within towns, to 100 km per hour (60 miles per hour) between cities. Road conditions often require much lower speeds.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Mali, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Mali’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nThe U.S. government has warned about the risks to civil aircraft operating into, out of, within, or over Mali due to hazards associated with ongoing fighting involving military forces and extremist/militant groups. The FAA advises U.S. civil aviation to avoid flying below a certain altitude in the airspace over Mali. For further information on FAA flight prohibitions, see  the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices ."

Your passport should be valid for at least three months beyond your planned departure date. You need proof of sufficient funds and a return airline ticket for entry. For additional details about travel into and within Schengen countries, please see  Traveling in Europe .\nDiplomats entering Malta on their diplomatic passport for more than 90 days are required to obtain a visa  prior  to entry into Malta. \nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any  HIV/AIDS  entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Malta. \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nCredible information indicates terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Europe. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks; however, all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations. Malta’s open borders with members of the Schengen zone allow the possibility of individual terrorists entering/exiting the country undetected.\nCRIME:  The most commonly reported crimes are  simple assault ,  pick-pocketing , and  petty theft . While armed robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides are not as common as in some major U.S. cities, they do occur. Criminals focus on areas and establishments frequented by tourists.\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nNightclubs:  You should be careful in the  Paceville  nightclub area, where excessive drinking, large crowds, and interaction with heavy-handed bouncers can lead to  violence , including some that appears to be  racially-motivated . Criminals have  drugged  some travelers at bars and  robbed  and  assaulted  them.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police by  dialing 112  and contact the U.S. Embassy at (+356) 2561-4000.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should contact the Embassy for assistance.\nMalta’s crime victim assistance agency,  Appogg , can be reached by calling its support line (dial 179) or by visiting its  website .\nThe local equivalent to the  911 emergency line  in Malta is  112 .\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not occur on a regular basis.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .  \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Your   U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution .\nJudicial Proceedings for Criminal Offenses in Malta:  Trials typically last  five to seven years  and are characterized by  lengthy  and sometimes  unpredictable   delays  between hearings. Foreign nationals can expect to be denied bail while a court case is ongoing, which can result in  lengthy periods of pre-trial detention  ranging from several months to several years. Obtaining no-fee legal aid can be a slow and difficult process, delaying already lengthy judicial proceedings.\nFurthermore, some crimes are also  prosecutable in the United States  regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.

The quality of medical care in Malta is  at U.S. standards; however, customer service standards are lower, there are cultural differences with regard to communication, and there may be long waiting times for non-urgent medical care . Medical specialists are few. Private hospitals generally offer better customer service, shorter wait times, and more amenities. Mater Dei is Malta’s main government hospital. Though it offers full service, including a modern emergency room and trauma facilities, it can be crowded and difficult to navigate.\nThe U.S. Government does not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S.  Medicare  does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides  coverage overseas . Most overseas care providers only accept cash payments.

These groups remain active and may conduct attacks including the use of simpler methods like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds.\nTravel is discouraged particularly in the easternmost region of Mauritania, due to activities by terrorist groups including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which are active in the neighboring regions of Mali.\nTraveling safely within Mauritania:  You should exercise prudence and caution when traveling in Mauritania. Be particularly vigilant when traveling by road outside of populated areas. The U.S. Embassy discourages travel outside of urban areas unless in a convoy accompanied by an experienced guide, and even then, only if equipped with sturdy vehicles and ample provisions.

Upon arrival at an airport, Mexican immigration authorities determine a traveler’s authorized length of stay and either place a date stamp in the traveler’s passport or direct the traveler through a self-service electronic gate (E-Gate) that generates a printed receipt with QR code. Air travelers who wish to download a record of their FMMD or find more information on the FMMD process may visit the  National Migration Institute’s (INM) website .\nTravelers entering Mexico by land must have a valid passport book or card. If you enter Mexico by land you must stop at an INM office or go online to  www.inm.gob.mx/fmme  to obtain an entry permit (Forma Migratoria Multiple or FMM), even if not explicitly directed to do so by Mexican officials. This includes travelers within the immediate border area (approximately 12 to 20 km into Mexico). The FMM must be stamped at an INM office upon entry to and exit from Mexico. INM may opt to allow tourists entry of up to 180 days without a visa or may limit authorized stays to shorter periods at their discretion; visitors should confirm the specific length of authorized stay written on the entry permit (FMM) or by the stamp in their passport. Mexican immigration authorities may ask you to present both your passport and entry permit if applicable at any point and may detain you while they review your immigration status if you are not carrying your passport and proof of legal status in Mexico, or if you have overstayed your authorized stay. Immigration check points are common in the interior of Mexico, including in popular tourist areas far from the border.\nTravelers bringing in goods beyond their personal effects (i.e.: items that go beyond the list of “What is included in your luggage” on the INM website) worth $300.00 or more when traveling by land and $500.00 or more when traveling by air must declare those goods with Mexican customs (SAT)  Mexican customs  ( Spanish only ) or risk having them confiscated. This also applies to used goods or clothing, including items for donation.\nMexican customs regulations also only allow one portable computer per passenger, per arrival, including laptops and tablets. Travelers who bring more than one device may face a duty of up to 19% of the deemed value of up to $4,000 of the device. \nU.S. citizens driving such items into Mexico without declaring such items or without sufficient funds to pay duty fees are subject to having their vehicle seized by Mexican customs authorities. Please visit the  website of the Embassy of Mexico  , for more information, and you may find general information on  customs restrictions  on our  website . \nTo bring a U.S.-registered vehicle beyond the border zone, you will need a temporary vehicle import permit. These permits are processed through Banjercito and require a deposit that will be refunded once the vehicle leaves Mexico. For more information, visit the  Banjercito  website ( Spanish only ).\nBaja California, Baja California Sur, and Sonora have a “hassle-free” zone that allows cars traveling without an entry permit or car registration within the zone. \nMexican authorities can impound a vehicle that enters the country without a valid U.S. registration, a vehicle driven by a Mexican national who is not resident in the United States, or a vehicle found beyond the border zone without the temporary import permit.\nMexican law permits Mexican immigration authorities to deny foreigners entry into Mexico if they have been charged with or convicted of a serious crime in Mexico or elsewhere.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents in Mexico.\nA parent or legal guardian departing Mexico with minor children should carry a notarized consent letter from the other parent if traveling separately. INM requires at least one parent to complete a  SAM  ( Formato de Salida de Menores, Spanish only ) for all Mexican or foreign minors with Temporary Resident, Temporary Student Resident, or Permanent Resident status departing Mexico alone or with a third party. Further information about the  prevention of international parental child abduction  is available on our website.\nBoth Mexico and the United States allow  dual nationality\nTravelers are urged to review the  Mexico Travel Advisory  for information about safety and security concerns affecting the country on a state-by-state basis.\nU.S. citizens traveling to and residing in Mexico should not expect public health and safety standards like those in the United States. Even where such standards exist, enforcement varies by location. Travelers should mitigate the risk of illness or injury by taking standard health and safety precautions.\nThe phone number to report emergencies in Mexico is “911.”  Although there may be English-speaking operators available, it is best to seek the assistance of a Spanish speaker to place the call.\nCrime:  Crime in Mexico occurs at a high rate and can be violent, from random street crime to cartel-related attacks. Over the past year, Mission Mexico has assisted U.S. citizens who were victims of armed robbery, carjacking, extortion, homicide, kidnapping, pick-pocketing, and sexual assault. Increased levels of cartel-related violence have resulted in territorial disputes and targeted killings, injuring or killing innocent bystanders. Travelers who find themselves in an active shooter scenario should flee in the opposite direction, if possible, or drop to the ground, preferably behind a hard barrier.\nDrivers on roads and highways may encounter government checkpoints, which often include National Guard or military personnel. State and local police also set up checkpoints in and around cities and along the highways to deter criminal activity and enforce traffic laws. In some parts of Mexico, criminal organizations and other non-governmental actors have been known to erect unauthorized checkpoints and have abducted or threatened violence against those who fail to stop and/or pay a “toll.” When approaching a checkpoint, regardless of whether it is official, cooperate and avoid any actions that may appear suspicious or aggressive.\nWhile Mexican authorities endeavor to safeguard the country’s major resort areas and tourist destinations, those areas have not been immune to the types of violence and crime experienced elsewhere in Mexico. In some areas of Mexico, response time of local police is often slow. In addition, filing police reports can be time consuming. See our  Mexico Travel Advisory  for more information.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  Protesters in Mexico may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares, or take control of toll booths on highways.  Travelers who encounter protesters who demand unofficial tolls are generally allowed to pass upon payment.  U.S. citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations or other activities that might be deemed political by authorities, as Mexican law prohibits political activities by foreign citizens and such actions may result in detention or deportation.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.  \nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Mexico. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:   \nMexico’s consumer protection agency,  PROFECO  (Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor, Spanish only), can sometimes  provide assistance  (Spanish only) to victims of such scams. In addition, there have been allegations of banking fraud perpetrated by private bankers against U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens who believe they have been victims of fraud can file a police report  file a complaint  (Spanish only) with the Mexican banking regulatory agency,  CONDUSEF  (Comision Nacional para la Proteccion y Defensa de los Usuarios de Servicios Financieros, Spanish only), or consult with an attorney.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest Consulate for assistance.  Report emergencies to the local police at 911, report crimes already committed to the Ministerio Publico, and contact the Embassy or Consulate at +52-55-85262561.  Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nU.S. citizen victims of crime should contact the local authorities to file a Mexican police report before departing Mexico. In most instances, victims of crime will file reports with the Ministerio Publico (equivalent to the office of public prosecutor or district attorney in the United States) and not with police first responders. U.S. citizens should also inform the  U.S. Embassy or nearest consulat e . \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .    We can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the  U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate  for assistance.\nKidnapping:  Mexico experiences very high rates of kidnapping.  If you believe you or your U.S. citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) relative has been kidnapped, please contact the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate immediately.\nRobbery:  Mexico experiences robberies, typically in cities, in which abductors force victims to use their debit or credit card to withdraw money from ATMs in exchange for their release. Perpetrators commonly work in cooperation with, or pose as, taxi drivers. To minimize the risk of such robberies:\nExtortion:  Extortion schemes are common in Mexico.  In a typical scheme known as a virtual kidnapping, criminals convince family members that a relative has been abducted, when, in fact, the person is safe but unreachable.  The purported abductors will often use threats to persuade victims to isolate themselves, making communication with family members less likely.  Unable to reach their loved ones, family members often consent to paying the “ransom” demand.  Criminals use various means to gather information about potential victims, including monitoring social media sites, eavesdropping on conversations, or using information taken from a stolen cell phone.  Some of these extortions have been conducted from Mexican prisons.  You can reduce the risk of falling victim to this type of extortion through the following:\nSexual Assault:  Rape and sexual assault are serious problems in some resort areas. Many of these incidents occur at night or during the early morning hours, in hotel rooms, on hotel grounds, or on deserted beaches. In some cases, assailants drug the drinks of victims before assaulting them. Pay attention to your surroundings and to who might have handled your drink.\nCredit/Debit Card “Skimming:”  There have been instances of fraudulent charges or withdrawals from accounts due to “skimmed” cards. If you choose to use credit or debit cards, you should regularly check your account to ensure there are no unauthorized transactions. Travelers should limit the amount of cash they carry in public, exercise caution when withdrawing cash from ATMs, and avoid ATMs located in isolated or unlit areas.\nAlcohol:  If you choose to drink alcohol, it is important to do so in moderation and to stop and seek medical attention if you begin to feel ill. There have been reports of individuals falling ill or blacking out after consuming unregulated alcohol. The Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risk,  COFEPRIS  ( Comision Federal para la Proteccion contra Riesgos Sanitarios, Spanish only ), is responsible for inspecting hotels, restaurants, and other establishments for health violations, including reports of unregulated alcohol. Please email COFEPRIS at  contactociudadano@cofepris.gob.mx  for more information or if you wish to file a report. You can file a report online (Spanish only) via the COFEPRIS website, by calling the COFEPRIS call center at 800 033 50 50 (from Mexico) or +52 (55) 5080-5425 (from the United States), or by scheduling an appointment  (Spanish only)  to visit a COFEPRIS office.\nThere have also been instances of criminals drugging drinks to rob or sexually assault victims. Additionally, if you feel you have been the victim of unregulated alcohol or another serious health violation, you should notify the  U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate . You may also contact the U.S. Department of State – Bureau of Consular Affairs in Washington, D.C. at 1-888-407-4747 (toll-free in the United States and Canada) or 1-202-501-4444 (from all other countries).\nDrug Smuggling:  Mexican criminal organizations are engaged in a violent struggle to control trafficking routes. Criminal organizations smuggling drugs into the United States have targeted unsuspecting individuals who regularly cross the border. Frequent border crossers are advised to vary their routes and travel times and to closely monitor their vehicles to avoid being targeted.\nTourism:  In major cities and resort areas, the tourism industry is generally well-regulated.  Best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced.  Hazardous areas and activities are identified with appropriate signage, and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and/or provide life-saving assistance.  In smaller towns and areas less commonly frequented by foreign tourists, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in or near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nSince 2016, Mexico has opened seven multilingual Centers for the Care and Protection of Tourists (CAPTA) and Tourist Assistance Centers (CATTAC) in Los Cabos, La Paz, Acapulco, Playa del Carmen, Mazatlan, Ciudad Madero, and Queretaro. These offices have proven helpful assisting U.S. citizen visitors in resolving disputes with merchants and government entities, filing criminal reports, securing needed services, and locating special needs accommodations. \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or nearest consulate immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nThe Mexican government is required by international law to contact the U.S. Embassy or consulate promptly when a U.S. citizen is arrested if the arrestee so requests.  This requirement does not apply to dual nationals.  \nFirearms and Other Weapons:  Weapons laws in Mexico vary by state, but it is generally illegal for travelers to carry weapons of any kind including firearms, knives, daggers, brass knuckles, as well as ammunition (even used shells). Illegal firearms trafficking from the United States to Mexico is a major concern, and the Department of State warns all U.S. citizens against taking any firearm or ammunition into Mexico. If you are caught entering Mexico with any type of weapon, including firearms or ammunitions, you likely will face severe penalties, including prison time. U.S.-issued permits allowing an individual to carry weapons are not valid in Mexico.  Visit the Department’s  Traveling Abroad with Firearms webpage .\nVessels entering Mexican waters with firearms or ammunition on board must have a permit previously issued by a Mexican embassy or consulate.\nDrugs:  Drug possession and use, including medical marijuana, is illegal in Mexico and may result in a lengthy jail sentence or fines.  \nElectronic Cigarettes (Vaping Devices):  It is illegal for travelers to bring electronic cigarettes (vaping devices) and all vaping solutions to Mexico. Customs will confiscate vaping devices and solutions and travelers could be fined or arrested. Avoid delays and possible sanctions by not taking these items to Mexico. \nReal Estate and Time Shares:  U.S. citizens should exercise caution when considering time-share investments or purchasing real estate and be aware of the aggressive tactics used by some sales representatives. Before initiating a real estate purchase or time-share investment, U.S. citizens should consult with a Mexican attorney to learn about important regulations and laws that govern real estate property.\nMountain Climbing and Hiking:  The Mexican government has declared the area around the Popocatepetl and the Colima volcanoes off limits. In remote rural areas, there can be limited cell phone coverage and internet connectivity, and it may be difficult for rescue teams and local authorities to reach climbers and hikers in distress.\nPotential for Natural Disasters:  Mexico is in an active earthquake zone. Tsunamis may occur following significant earthquakes. Please visit our  disaster and crisis preparedness  webpage for more information. For additional information concerning disasters, see:\nStorm Season:  Tropical storms can produce heavy winds and rain between May and November. Please visit our disaster and crisis preparedness webpage for more information.\nSpring Break:  Millions of U.S. citizens visit Mexican beach resorts each year, especially during “ spring break ” season. The legal drinking age in Mexico is 18. See the “Alcohol” section above to learn more about the risks associated with drinking, as well as reports of illnesses associated with the possible consumption of unregulated alcohol.\nResort Areas and Water Activities:  Beaches in Mexico may be dangerous due to strong currents, rip tides, and rogue waves. Warning notices and flags on beaches should be taken seriously. Not all hazardous beaches are clearly marked. If black or red warning flags are up, do not enter the water. Strong currents can lead to dangerous conditions for even the most experienced swimmers. U.S. citizens simply walking along the shore or wading have been swept out to sea by rogue waves, and some citizens have drowned or disappeared at Mexican beaches. Avoid the consumption of alcohol while engaging in water activities and do not swim alone. \nBoats used for excursions may not be covered by accident insurance and sometimes lack adequate life jackets, radios, and tools to make repairs.  Participation in adventure sports may not be covered by accident insurance and safety protections and regulations for these activities may differ from U.S. standards.  Visit  our website  and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about adventure travel.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also be subject to fines or forced to relinquish the goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or on the organization of LGB events in Mexico. However, due to sporadic reports of violence targeting LGB individuals, U.S. citizens should exercise discretion in identifying themselves publicly as LGB. See our LGB Travel Information page and Section 6 of the  Department of State’s Human Rights Report for Mexico  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:   Mexican law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities.  Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States.  The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in more rural and remote parts of the country, and more common in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in major cities.  U.S. citizens with disabilities should consult individual hotels and service providers in advance of travel to ensure they are accessible.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  There were several reports of sexual assault or domestic violence involving U.S. citizen women over the past year. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nExcellent health facilities are available in Mexico City and other major cities. Ambulance services are widely available, but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi to a health provider. Mexican facilities often require payment “up front” before providing medical care, and most hospitals in Mexico do not accept U.S. health insurance. A  list of doctors and hospitals  is available on the U.S. Embassy or consulate website.\nU.S. citizens have lodged complaints against some private hospitals in Cancun, the Riviera Maya, and Los Cabos to include exorbitant prices and inflexible collection measures.  Travelers should obtain complete information on billing, pricing, and proposed medical procedures before agreeing to any medical care in these locations.  Be aware that some resorts have exclusive agreements with medical providers and ambulance services, which may limit your choices in seeking emergency medical attention.  Some hospitals in tourist centers utilize sliding scales, deciding on rates for services based on negotiation and on the patient’s perceived ability to pay.  In some instances, providers have been known to determine the limits of a patient’s credit card or insurance, quickly reach that amount in services rendered, and subsequently discharge the patient or transfer them to a public hospital.\nVisit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  website for information on Medical Tourism.\nFor emergency services in Mexico, dial  911 .  Although there may be English-speaking operators available, it is best to seek the assistance of a Spanish speaker to place the call.\nAmbulance services are: \nWe do not pay medical bills:  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.  \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance coverage overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. \nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation as well.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.  Check the  Mexican government’s Drug Schedule  to ensure the medication is legal in Mexico. \nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information :\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals .  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery: \nPharmaceuticals\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy   \nCarbon Monoxide\nWater Quality: \nAltitude: \nAdventure Travel\nGeneral Health\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nAir Quality\nFor further health information, go to:\n  Private Residential Treatment Facilities: \nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of U.S. citizen deaths in Mexico. If you have an emergency while driving, dial “911.” If you are driving on a toll highway (“ cuota ”) or any other major highway, you may contact the Green Angels ( Spanish only ), a fleet of trucks with bilingual crews, by dialing 078 from any phone in Mexico.  Generally, individuals involved in an accident who do not require immediate medical care should contact their insurance providers, who may come to the site to provide an immediate assessment.\nAvoid driving on Mexican highways at night. Travel with a charged and functional cell phone capable of making calls in Mexico. Travelers should exercise caution at all times and should use toll (“ cuota ”) roads rather than the less secure free (“ libre ”) roads whenever possible. Do not hitchhike or accept rides from or offer rides to strangers anywhere in Mexico. Travelers encountering police or security checkpoints should comply with instructions.\nRoad conditions and maintenance across Mexico vary with many road surfaces needing repair. Travel in rural areas poses additional risks to include spotty cell phone coverage and delays in receiving roadside or medical assistance.\nVehicular traffic in Mexico City is subject to restriction Monday through Saturday, according to the license plate number, in order to reduce air pollution. For additional information, refer to the  Hoy No Circula website  ( Spanish only ) maintained by the Mexico City government. See our  Road Safety Page  for more information.  Also, visit  Mexico’s national tourist office website , MexOnline, and Mexico’s customs website  Importacion Temporal de Vehiculos  ( Spanish only ) for more information regarding travel and transportation.\nTraffic Laws:   U.S. driver’s licenses are valid in Mexico. Mexican law requires that only owners drive their vehicles or that the owner be inside the vehicle. Failing to abide by this law may lead to impoundment and a fine equal to the value of the vehicle.\nMexican citizens who are not also U.S. citizens or LPRs may not operate U.S.-registered vehicles in Mexico. Mexican insurance is required for all vehicles, including rental vehicles. Drivers involved in accidents, even minor incidents, may be subject to arrest if they are found to be driving without proper insurance, regardless of whether they were at fault. Driving under the influence of alcohol, using a mobile device while driving, and driving through a yellow light are all illegal in Mexico.\nIf you drive your vehicle into Mexico beyond the immediate border area (approximately 12 miles into Mexico), you must apply for a temporary vehicle import permit with Mexican customs,  Banjercito , or at some Mexican consulates in the United States. The permit requires the presentation of a valid passport and a monetary deposit that will be returned to you upon leaving Mexico before the expiration of the permit. Failing to apply for a temporary vehicle import permit may lead to impoundment and a fine equal to the value of the vehicle. \nVehicles crossing into Mexico must have a valid license plate and registration sticker. Mexican authorities will often refuse to admit vehicles with temporary or paper license plates. Vehicles with expired registration or unauthorized plates will likely be confiscated and the operator could be charged with a fine equal to the value of the vehicle.\nThe  Mission Mexico Vehicle Recovery Unit  assists with the return of stolen U.S. vehicles recovered by Mexican authorities.\nIf you have an emergency while driving, dial “911.” If you are driving on a toll highway (“cuota”) or any other major highway, you may contact the Green Angels (Spanish only), a fleet of trucks with bilingual crews, by dialing 078 from any phone in Mexico.  Generally, individuals involved in an accident who do not require immediate medical care should contact their insurance providers, who may come to the site to provide an immediate assessment.\nPublic Transportation/Taxis:  Security on public buses varies throughout the country but is considered a relatively safe transportation option in Mexico City and other major tourist centers. Passengers should protect their personal possessions at all times as theft is common. Intercity bus travel should be conducted during daylight hours in preferably first-class buses using toll roads.\nRobberies and assaults on passengers in taxis not affiliated with a taxi stand (known as “libre” taxis) are common. Avoid taking any taxi not summoned by telephone or contacted in advance, including “libre” taxis. When in need of a taxi, telephone a radio taxi or “sitio” (regulated taxi stand) and ask the dispatcher for the driver’s name and the taxi’s license plate number. Application-based car services such as Uber and Cabify are available in many Mexican cities, and generally offer another safe alternative to taxis. Official complaints against Uber and other drivers do occur, however, and past disputes between these services and local taxi unions have occasionally turned violent, resulting in injuries to U.S. citizens in some instances.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Mexico’s Civil Aviation Authority as not being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Mexico’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:   Mariners planning travel to Mexico should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts .  Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings .\nIf you enter by sea, review  the Mexican boating permit requirements  prior to travel or contact the  Embassy of Mexico  in Washington, D.C., for more information.\nMaritime Safety Oversight:  The Mexican maritime industry, including charter fishing and recreational vessels, is subject solely to Mexican safety regulations.  Travelers should be aware that Mexican equipment and vessels may not meet U.S. safety standards or be covered by any accident insurance."

If your passport is not valid for three months, you may be refused boarding by the airline at your point of origin or while transferring planes  en route  to Moldova. The U.S. Embassy, however, recommends that you have at least six months validity on your passport. To ensure that your travel plans are not disrupted, plan ahead to renew your passport before traveling. Visit the Department of State’s  passport website  for information on applying for a new or renewed passport.\nThere are no special requirements for U.S. citizens entering Moldova from Romania or Ukraine at official entry points. If you enter Moldova through the separatist region of Transnistria, you should register your arrival within three days with Moldovan authorities. Transnistria is a breakaway region that is not under the control of the central government in Chisinau. A separatist regime controls the region and access to U.S. citizens is difficult. The U.S. Embassy may not be able to help if you encounter difficulties there. For more information on travel to Transnistria, please see the section on “Safety and Security” in the  Moldova International Travel Information website .\nEntering Moldova by Car \nTo enter Moldova by car, a driver must be prepared to submit the following documents to the Border Police Officer:\nNote: U.S. Military Official Travel and Leave; Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) documents, i.e., vehicle registrations, personnel IDs etc. are NOT valid/accepted documents for entering the Republic of Moldova by land.\nVisits and Residence Permits\nU.S. citizens can stay in Moldova without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Upon entry or exit from Moldova, Border Police officers will check the amount of time you stayed in Moldova without a visa in the 180-day period preceding the date when your passport is being checked. U.S. citizens who leave the country and return after spending less than 90 days in the 180-day period prior to their return, will be admitted for the remainder of the 90 days. U.S. citizens attempting to re-enter Moldova after having already spent 90 days in the country in the 180-day period prior to their return may be denied re-entry to Moldova.\nExtending your stay in Moldova\nU.S. citizens who would like to stay in the Republic of Moldova for more than 90 days must apply for a residence permit. The residence permit may be obtained at the General Inspectorate for Migration offices located at the following locations:\n124 Stefan cel Mare Blvd., Chisinau \n9 Moscovei Street, Balti \n22 Comsomolului Street, Comrat \n79 Ioan Voda cel Cumplit Street, Cahul\nInformation on the application process can be found on the General Inspectorate for Migration  website.  The application for a residence permit must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the expiration of your legal stay in the Republic of Moldova.\nIf you already have a Moldovan residence permit, you must notify the General Inspectorate for Migration about any address change within 15 days. Failure to report your change of address may result in fines.\nNote: If you apply for a Moldovan residence permit, you will need to supply a police certificate from countries of previous residence. All public documents issued or obtained in the United States must be authenticated for use in Moldova with an  apostille certificate . See the section on obtaining a U.S. criminal records request below for more information.\nCustoms/Import, Transiting and Export of Strategic Goods\nThe Moldovan authorities enforce strict rules and regulations as to what can be brought in and out of the country. The number of incidents involving U.S. citizens trying to bring in prohibited or strategic goods/“dual use” items has increased since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the closing of all air routes in and out of Ukraine. Please note that if you try to bring in any restricted and/or prohibited items into Moldova without proper authorization, your items may be confiscated, and you may be charged a fine or detained. Please visit the Moldovan government’s public services site found here:  Public Services Portal-Autorizaţie individuală de reexport a... (egov.md)  for more information. You can find a list of prohibited items  here  and restricted items  here.  Please note that these lists should not be considered exhaustive but subject to interpretation at the point of entry. If you enter with humanitarian goods, you will need to complete a Traveler Customs Declaration form, and provide an invoice confirming the value of the goods, and a donation letter. If the humanitarian goods are meant for Ukraine, you will need to submit the articles through a customs broker. Please read the information carefully. We remind all U.S. citizens that they are subject to Moldovan laws and regulations, including border and customs regulations, once they enter the Republic of Moldova. The U.S. Embassy cannot assist in reclaiming items confiscated by Moldovan customs.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Moldova.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nDemonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. \nTransnistria Region\nTransnistria is a breakaway region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government in Chisinau. Visitors are required to present identification to cross the administrative boundary of the Transnistria region; those without a Moldovan government-issued identification document may be requested to present a passport. Visitors may also be required to present identification and/or a passport at additional checkpoints manned by uniformed peacekeepers along roads leading into and out of the region. Ukraine has closed its border crossing points into the Transnistrian region. Taking photographs of military facilities and security forces is prohibited and may result in trouble with authorities.\nThe U.S. government’s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria maybe be limited or delayed since Transnistria’s de facto authorities control access to the region.\nCrime : Reported types of crime include:\nInternational Financial Scams : See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime : U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault, should report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(373) (22) 40-83-00. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nU.S. citizens should be aware that there have been reports of widespread corruption in all areas of the judicial system, including case dismissals without cause. In most cases, an investigation will not proceed if the complainant leaves the country prior to full conclusion of proceedings. Persons wishing to report incidents of corruption may contact the National Anticorruption Center hotline: 0 800 55555 active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence : U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism : The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .\nCriminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the U.S.  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nIf you are arrested, you can face extended periods, even years, in pre-trial detention.\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe, and if convicted, you can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\nYou should register large sums of foreign currency (equivalent of 10,000 Euros and above) and declare all valuable goods with Moldovan customs authorities when you arrive in Moldova. Failure to do so can result in confiscation, fines, and/or arrest.\nFor more information about customs requirements, see the  Moldovan Customs webpage .\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods : Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Moldova. However, traditional cultural attitudes towards LGB individuals may result in discrimination and harassment. \nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities : The law in Moldova prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in lodging and general infrastructure and common in public transportation and information. The general infrastructure for disabled people is not developed in the villages and in the small cities as it is in the capital. Some accessibility equipment and devices can be bought and repaired in Moldova. It’s difficult to find a sign language interpreter service in Moldova.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nSpecial Circumstances:  Credit cards are accepted in Chisinau, and occasionally in the rest of the country, but rarely in small villages. Use your credit card with caution and protect your personal information.\nIndividuals considering doing business in Transnistria, a breakaway region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government in Chisinau, should exercise extreme caution. Many Transnistrian firms are not legally registered with Moldovan authorities, which may complicate or prevent the import or export of goods. The government of Moldova will not recognize the validity of contracts for the privatization of firms in Transnistria without the approval of the appropriate Moldovan authorities. Western credit cards and cell phones do not work in Transnistria; Moldovan leii are not accepted as a form of payment in Transnistria.\nThe U.S. government’s ability to provide services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria may be limited or delayed since Transnistria’s de facto authorities control access to the region.\nFor emergency services in Moldova, dial 112.\nAmbulance services are:\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Moldovan  Medicines and Medical Devices Agency  to ensure the medication is legal in Moldova.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality : Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals  here.  We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nTuberculosis  is an increasingly serious health concern in Moldova.\nRoad Conditions and Safety: \nRoad conditions in Moldova are different from those in the United States.\nRoads often lack signage and are unevenly maintained.\nAvoid driving at night due to poorly lit roads.\nIt is common to see tractors, bicyclists, horse-drawn carts, pedestrians, and livestock on the same road.\nBe cautious in pedestrian areas; not all drivers stop for pedestrians at crosswalks.\nTraffic Laws:\nTo be safe, don’t drink alcohol before driving. The maximum legal blood alcohol content is 0.03 percent (well under the acceptable limit in the United States).\nIf you are stopped by traffic police for driving under the influence of alcohol and are told that you will receive a fine or will be arrested, request a blood test to confirm your actual blood alcohol level.\nPublic Transportation: \nThe public transportation network is well developed but differences to keep in mind include:\nSome trains, trolleybuses, and buses are old and can break down.\nTaxis are available in most urban areas and vary from very old and poorly maintained to new western European or U.S. vehicles.\nRoad emergency services are generally responsive, although you may not find an English-speaking operator.\nTo reach the police and/or an ambulance, call 112.\nSee our  Road Safety  page for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Moldova, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Moldova’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil\nAviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

But your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your date of arrival. All foreign nationals, no matter their duration of stay, must register with the Immigration Agency of Mongolia within 48 hours of their arrival in country. The individual or their housing provider can do this. Registration can be done online through the  Immigration Agency of Mongolia’s website . If you don’t register, you may face fines upon departure. You may not leave until you pay the fine to the Mongolian Immigration Agency.\nYou will also be fined if you stay beyond your 90-day admission, even if due to circumstances beyond your control. You must pay this fine in full. It accumulates daily for every day beyond 90 days. Mongolian authorities will not allow you to leave otherwise.\nWork, Study, Reside:  If you plan to visit, work, study, or reside in Mongolia for more than 90 days you must apply for a visa at the  Mongolian Embassy in Washington, DC ,  the Mongolian Consulate General in San Francisco , or the  Mongolian Mission to the United Nations in New York  before you leave the United States.\nOverland Travel to/from China or Russia:  Only the Zamiin Uud border crossing in the south with China and the Sukhbaatar/Altanbulag border crossing in the north with Russia, are always open to foreign travelers. Other overland ports of entry are open sporadically. The  status of border crossings  is available in Mongolian.\nSee the Country Specific Information pages on  China  and  Russia  for additional information on the entry, exit, and transit requirements for those countries.\nOther Entry and Exit Requirements:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Mongolia.\nAdditional Information:\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTravelers are urged to review the  Mongolia Travel Advisory , which provides information about safety and security concerns affecting the country.\nThe phone number to report crimes to the  local police in Mongolia is 102 . The number to call an  ambulance or fire truck in an emergency is 103 . Please note that local authorities, including emergency responders, usually do not speak English.\nCrime:  Mongolia is a relatively safe country for foreigners. But both street crime and violent crime are on the rise, especially in the larger towns and cities. Crime typically peaks during the Naadam summer festival in July and during the Tsagaan Sar (Lunar New Year) festival in January or February. Most street crime occurs late at night, often outside bars and nightclubs.\nTheft:  Pickpocketing and bag-snatching can occur at any time, especially in crowded places like markets, train stations, and popular tourist attractions. You should take precautions to protect your personal effects when in public. The embassy has also received reports of visitors’ accommodations being burgled while occupied. These burglaries most often occurred when travelers were staying in yurt (ger) camps.  It may be impossible to lock the doors to these accommodations.\nRobbery:  Mugging is the most common robbery of visitors to Mongolia. You are most likely to be mugged if you are alone in unfamiliar urban neighborhoods after dark, or in unlicensed taxis. Stick to well-lit and well-established tourist areas. Use registered taxis whenever possible.\nSexual Assault:  Though infrequent, the Embassy does receive reports of sexual assaults perpetrated against travelers. These reports show   that perpetrators are most often familiar with the victim. They include tour guides and employees of locations frequented by tourists, like ger camps and monasteries. If you are a victim of sexual assault, you may contact the Mongolian police. You can also seek help from the Embassy at +976 7007-6001. Female travelers should avoid solo travel in Mongolia. All travelers should research and hire only reputable tour agencies with established safety and security records, especially when visiting remote areas far from the capital.\nThe police will instruct victims of sexual assault to get an examination at the criminal forensic institute, which is in Ulaanbaatar city or in provincial centers. A medical check from any other clinic/hospital will not be admitted into evidence at any judicial proceeding. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers.\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\nStreet Harassment:  Street harassment is especially prevalent at night and in areas outside the capital. The most common targets of street harassment are unaccompanied women and foreign men accompanying Mongolian or other Asian women. Street harassment may range from verbal abuse to physical assault. Some nationalist groups also carry out planned attacks against foreigners. Most street harassment occurs in or near bars and nightclubs, and alcohol is often involved. All travelers should avoid walking alone after dark. They should also avoid unregistered taxis and limit their alcohol. This will help avoid harassment in public.\nDrug Offenses:  Mongolian police want to combat drug use. They often see it as a problem imported by foreigners. In Mongolia, drug possession and trafficking carry a prison term of one to twelve years.\nSmuggling of Contraband Goods, Antiquities, and Wildlife:  Smuggling of these items is prevalent across both the Russian and Chinese borders. Travelers have been known to be duped into transporting contraband goods or controlled antiquities from Mongolia. Be wary of other passengers requesting help with their luggage, as it could contain illicit articles. Mongolia’s smuggling penalties vary based on the item.  They range from one month of electronic monitoring to eight years imprisonment. Fines from 450,000 MNT to 40,000,000 MNT equal to 130 USD to 12000 USD as of September 2024.\nDemonstrations:  Demonstrations are common in many parts of Mongolia. They are most common in the capital, Ulaanbaatar. Even peaceful demonstrations can become confrontational and escalate into violence. Protesters may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstration areas and exercise caution if near any protests. Some Mongolian ultra-nationalist demonstrations may become xenophobic. This poses a risk to foreigners who might encounter them. U.S. citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations and other activities that might be deemed political by Mongolian authorities.\nAlcohol:  If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. If you feel ill, stop and seek medical help. Alcohol is important to Mongolian social culture. Strangers may offer drinks to travelers as a welcoming gesture. Most of these offers are harmless and friendly. But travelers should be wary of accepting beverages offered on the street by strangers on the street at night.  These are often a prelude to a robbery. The widespread use of alcohol links to many fights. U.S. citizen travelers have, knowingly or unknowingly become involved in such fights and injured.\nDriving Under the Influence:  Mongolian police take driving under the influence very seriously. They vigorously enforce the law in urban areas. Penalties for driving under the influence in Mongolia include a one-year suspension of driving privileges and a 400,000 MNT fine, roughly 120 USD as of December 2024. Travelers should exercise the same precautions as they would in the United States, use of a designated driver or a taxi, to avoid operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.\nVictims of Crime: Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.  If you are the victim of a crime, you may contact the local authorities to file a Mongolian police report. You should also inform the U.S. embassy. A crime may only be reported in person at the local police district having jurisdiction over the location where the crime occurred. You must have your passport or residency permit with you.  Before reporting a crime, you may wish to consult an attorney. The U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of English-speaking lawyers  that you may access online. Once you report a crime to the police Mongolian law requires that you remain in the country for the duration of both the investigation and any subsequent trial. In some instances, the law provides for a victim to appoint a legal representative to take their place.\nThe police will instruct victims of assault or sexual assault to undergo an examination by the criminal forensic institute which is located in Ulaanbaatar or in provincial centers. No other medical examination will be accepted as evidence by Mongolian authorities. The Embassy can assist in helping you locate these centers.\nIt is important to note that, if a victim does not file a complaint, police may refuse to investigate the crime--even if they have probable cause to suspect that a crime took place.\nPlease see our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nIf you are the victim of a crime the U.S. embassy can:\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated. Mongolia’s vast area and limited road and communications infrastructure make emergency response challenging for local and national authorities. Mongolia can experience severe weather. This raises the risk of urgent situations if one gets lost or disoriented outside of city centers. The embassy recommends travelers not drive outside of Ulaanbaatar or other city centers after sunset.  In winter, visitors should keep high-quality cold-weather clothing in vehicles. This is important, even for short trips. It will provide protection in the event of delay or becoming stranded.  Routine safety inspections for emergency and medical equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities may lack proper signs. Tour guides and staff may not be properly trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. After an injury, basic medical care is usually only in/near major cities. Medications and healthcare are often of poor quality.  First responders are generally unable to quickly access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .  \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, then you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\nFurthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States, even if violated abroad. For examples, see the  Department of Justice  website and our website on  crimes against minors abroad .\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained,  ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. embassy immediately.  See our  webpage  for further information.\nCustoms:  Mongolian customs authorities strictly enforce laws regulating the import and export of firearms, ammunition, precious metals, antiquities and drugs. Importation of firearms or ammunition requires prior government approval. All precious metals should be declared on arrival. Exporting antiquities requires a special customs clearance certificate issued by an authorized antique dealer at the time of sale. Importing medicines is not allowed. Medicines for personal use must have doctor’s prescription. Vitamins are limited only for personal use and bringing more than 2 packages will result in taxation. For additional information, contact the  Embassy of Mongolia .\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Mongolia’s criminal code prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality, language, race, age, gender, social status, professional position, religion, education, or medical status. There are no laws or legal provisions that criminalize being LGB or that specifically target the LGB community. Yet, NGOs continue to report that LGB individuals face violence and discrimination both in public and at home based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. There were also reports that LGB persons face greater discrimination and fear in rural areas than in Ulaanbaatar. The Government of Mongolia does not recognize same-sex spouses for visa and residency purposes.\nSee   our   LGB Travel Information  and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  Ulaanbaatar’s main streets have textured sidewalks for the visually impaired. But many obstacles hinder disabled people from moving freely. Government buildings and public transportation remain largely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. Mongolian elevators are often too small fora standard wheelchair. Service animals are rare and are often barred from entering public buildings.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Domestic violence and sexual assault are serious problems in Mongolia. See the Safety & Security section above, as well as our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nWith few exceptions, Mongolian hospitals do not meet Western standards. Although most doctors and emergency responders are dedicated professionals, their training and equipment are sub-standard. Most modern medical facilities are in Ulaanbaatar, though some public and private hospitals in larger provincial cities offer medical services on par with those in the capital. Medical services may be completely unavailable in remote areas. Mongolia lacks helicopter medical evacuation. In remote areas, those needing help must drive to the nearest major town. Medical evacuation to Ulaanbaatar is conducted by commercial air carriers. Some pharmacies in Ulaanbaatar carry European or U.S. pharmaceuticals. But their stock is limited. Most pharmaceuticals are made in China or Russia and lack English labels. See our  list of medical facilities in Ulaanbaatar .\nAir Quality:  Due to the pervasiveness of coal-burning for domestic heating, Ulaanbaatar and most other Mongolian cities suffer severe air pollution during winter. The U.S. Embassy’s air quality monitor shows Air Quality Indices (AQIs) over 300 most days from December through February. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes AQIs above 300 as “hazardous.” Air pollution can harm health, both in the short and long term. It is especially risky for children, pregnant women, the elderly, outdoor enthusiasts, and people with heart or lung disease. Travelers planning to visit Ulaanbaatar during winter should consult a doctor. At a minimum, they should, consider carrying an N95 mask to help filter out harmful particulates. For reliable and timely air pollution readings, check the U.S. Embassy’s live  air quality monitor .\nWater Quality:  The quality of drinking water varies throughout Mongolia, and it is likely not up to U.S. standards for potability. Most Mongolians do not drink tap water and instead prefer to consume bottled water for their domestic use.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation. The U.S. embassy does not provide medical evacuation nor pay medical bills.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the  Mongolian Embassy  to ensure the medication is legal in Mongolia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended  by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety: Operating a vehicle outside of Ulaanbaatar is unsafe , particularly after dark. Outside of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia has few paved roads and even fewer streetlights. Most roads have only two lanes and no shoulders and most sealed roads need resurfacing. Trucks commonly carry overloaded cargo. Livestock crossing roads, even high traffic ones, is common. Pedestrians also cross all types of roads at undesignated locations. Passing is difficult and dangerous due to the narrow, highly-trafficked nature of the roads.\nMongolian motorists can be aggressive. They often cut each other off, make illegal turns, run red lights, and suddenly stop in the road. Moreover, driving while intoxicated is common. Mongolia drives on the right. But over half of all vehicles have right-side steering wheels. Most motorcycle and moped drivers have limited experience sharing the road. Motorists rarely respect pedestrians’ right-of-way, even in crosswalks.\nDriving off-road  in Mongolia can be dangerous, without a local guide. Those considering off-road driving in Mongolia should bring a few things. They should have standard vehicle maintenance equipment, a good GPS unit, and a reliable satellite phone. Be extra careful when driving off-road in winter. Stranded in remote areas, foreign drivers may face deadly situations. They may lack food, water, and heat.  Mongolia’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) can assist stuck vehicles during weather emergencies. But there is no government agency dedicated to helping stuck vehicles.\nTraffic Laws:  To help reduce traffic and air pollution, police actively restrict certain license plate numbers from driving into downtown Ulaanbaatar on certain days of the week, usually alternating odd/even numbers.\nIt is not legal to drive in Mongolia with a U.S. driver’s license. U.S. citizen tourists may drive in Mongolia for six months with a valid international driver’s license. After that, they must have a Mongolian license. Automobile insurance is mandatory. For information on Mongolian driver’s licenses, vehicle inspection, road taxes, and vehicle insurance, contact the  Embassy of Mongolia  in Washington, DC. in Washington, DC.\nIf you are in a collision  do not move your vehicle. Wait for the police or insurance company to assess the scene, even if it is blocking traffic. Moving your vehicle will incur a fine. Be prepared to wait. It can take hours for the police or the insurance company to arrive at the crash site.\nPublic Transportation:  Ulaanbaatar has a fairly reliable bus system. Bus maps are in English. Buses can get very crowded, so watch for pickpockets. Ulaanbaatar has many unofficial, unregistered, un-metered taxis. Registered taxis are also available but may refuse service during rush hour.\nThe safety and maintenance standards of rental car companies vary. Local tour companies can provide cars with drivers. But the drivers’ experience, knowledge, and English skills will vary.\nFor more information, please visit our  Road Safety  page.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Mongolia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Mongolia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page ."

The potential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens exists in Morocco. Long an important counterterrorism partner with the United States, Morocco’s capable security services have taken robust actions to guard against terrorist attacks. Moroccan authorities continue to disrupt groups seeking to attack U.S. or Western-affiliated and Moroccan government targets, arresting numerous individuals associated with international terrorist groups. Nevertheless, credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in the region, including Morocco. Lone wolf attacks are difficult to detect and disrupt and can occur without warning. In December 2018, two Scandinavian tourists were murdered by three Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) supporters in the Imlil Mountains near Marrakesh. U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regards to their personal security.\nEstablishments that are identifiable with the United States are potential targets for attacks. These may include facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate, including clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, hotels, movie theaters, U.S. brand establishments, and other public areas.  U.S. citizen campers should camp in guarded campgrounds rather than isolated campsites.\nDemonstrations:  Demonstrations occur frequently in Morocco, are typically focused on political or social issues, and are only rarely confrontational or violent.\nWestern Sahara:  From 1975 to 1991, Western Sahara was the site of armed conflict between Moroccan government forces and the POLISARIO Front, which continues to seek independence for the territory. Tensions along the border in Western Sahara heightened in November 2020 when Moroccan forces conducted an operation on the border to clear a blockade by the POLISARIO Front; both sides have since engaged in a low intensity conflict along the border. There are thousands of unexploded mines in the Western Sahara and in areas of Mauritania adjacent to the Western Saharan border. Exploding mines are occasionally reported and have caused death and injury. There have been instances in which U.S. citizens suspected of being participants in political protests or of supporting NGOs that are critical of Moroccan policies have been expelled from, or not been allowed to enter, Western Sahara.\nCrime:  Crime in Morocco is a serious concern, particularly in major cities and tourist areas.\n*  NOTE: Some popular web-based ride-sharing services have operated in Morocco; however, the French-based company Heetch is currently the only service legally authorized to operate by the Moroccan Government. Media report that drivers of web-based ride-sharing services have been harassed and assaulted by regular taxi drivers in the recent past.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of crimes should contact the local police at 19 from a land line or 190 from a mobile phone, and the U.S. Consulate in Casablanca at (212) 522 64 20 99. Remember that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. See our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nTourism : The tourism industry is generally regulated in major tourist areas.  Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. However, outside of these areas, the tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. In some places you may be taken in for questioning if you don’t have your passport with you.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Consulate immediately. See our  webpage  for further information. \n\nFaith-Based Travelers : Islam is the official religion in Morocco. However, the constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion. The Moroccan government does not interfere with public worship by the country’s Jewish minority or by expatriate Christians. Proselytizing is, however, prohibited. In the past, U.S. citizens have been arrested, detained, and/or expelled for discussing or trying to engage Moroccans in debate about Christianity. In February 2014, several U.S. citizens were expelled from Morocco for alleged proselytizing. Many of those expelled were long-time Moroccan residents. In these cases, U.S. citizens were given no more than 48 hours to gather their belongings or settle their affairs before being expelled. See the  Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report .\nLGB Travelers:  Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Morocco. Penalties include fines and jail time. See   our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  While in Morocco, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is customary in the United States. \nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers : Women walking alone in certain areas of cities and rural areas are particularly vulnerable to assault by men. They should exercise caution when in public spaces, including nightclubs or other social establishments. Women are advised to travel with a companion or in a group when possible and to ignore any harassment. See our tips for  Women Travelers .\nCustoms:  Travelers must declare large quantities of U.S. dollars brought into the country at the port of entry. The export of Moroccan currency (dirhams) is prohibited; however, Moroccan currency can be converted back into U.S. dollars prior to departure only if the traveler has a bank or money transfer receipt indicating he or she exchanged dollars for dirhams while in Morocco.\nMoroccan customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation into or export from Morocco of items such as firearms, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drones, religious materials, antiquities, business equipment, and large quantities of currency. It is advisable to contact the  Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C.,  or the  Moroccan Consulate General in New York  for specific information concerning customs requirements.\nPlease see our information on  Customs and Import Restrictions.\nCitizenship : The Government of Morocco considers all persons born to Moroccan fathers to be Moroccan citizens. In addition to being subject to all U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who also possess the nationality of Morocco may be subject to other laws that impose special obligations on citizens of Morocco. Recently, Morocco has begun allowing Moroccan mothers of children born outside Morocco to petition for their children’s citizenship. For further information on that process, please contact the  Embassy of Morocco in Washington, D.C.,  or the  Moroccan Consulate General in New York .\nResidency Permits:  In order to obtain a residence permit, travelers must present (among other requirements) a criminal history record check. This record check can only be obtained in the United States. The U.S. Consulate and Embassy are unable to take fingerprints to send for FBI record requests. For specific information, individuals seeking residency should visit their local police station. \nThe following documents must accompany a residency renewal application:\nIndividuals planning on residing in Morocco or relocating to the U.S. may be asked to provide a notarized change of residence form. This form is available at the U.S. Consulate by appointment.\nSending Passports through the Mail:  According to Moroccan law, it is prohibited to send passports by mail across international borders. Passports sent to or through Morocco via Fedex, DHL, or other courier will be confiscated by Moroccan authorities. Confiscated U.S. passports are eventually sent to the U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca after being processed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If your passport has been confiscated, you can contact the American Citizens Services section at  acscasablanca@state.gov  to ask if it has been received.\nProperty:  U.S. consular officers are prohibited by law and regulation from accepting personal property for safekeeping regardless of the circumstances involved. If there is concern over the protection of property left behind in Morocco due to confiscation or deportation for political, legal, or other reasons, U.S. citizens should take every precaution to ensure that available legal safeguards are in place either before, or immediately after, purchasing property in Morocco or taking up residence there. U.S. citizens are also encouraged to consider assigning a Power of Attorney, or Procuration, to be used in Morocco if necessary. More information and sample Power of Attorney forms are available on the  Consulate General of the Kingdom of Morocco in New York  website.\nPhotographing Sensitive Locations:  Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with the authorities. As a general rule, travelers should not photograph palaces, diplomatic missions, government buildings, or other sensitive facilities and when in doubt should ask permission from the appropriate Moroccan authorities.\nProfessional Basketball in Morocco:  The U.S. Consulate General in Casablanca is aware that there are local professional basketball teams who have made contracts with U.S. citizens to play on Moroccan teams. Some of these players have subsequently claimed they were not paid as stipulated per the terms of the contract.  Individuals considering playing basketball professionally in Morocco may wish to consult with a lawyer regarding the terms of their contract prior to signing. A  list of lawyers  can be found on the Embassy's webpage.\nAdequate medical care is available in Morocco’s largest cities, particularly in Rabat and Casablanca, although not all facilities meet Western standards.\nThe U.S. Mission in Morocco is unable to pay your medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. You may also be required to pay a deposit before being admitted for treatment. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the  Government of Morocco Ministry of Foreign Affairs  to ensure the medication is legal in Morocco. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. \nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n\nFurther health information:\n \nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic accidents are a significant hazard in Morocco. Driving practices are very poor and have resulted in serious injuries to and fatalities of U.S. citizens. This is particularly true at dusk during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, when adherence to traffic regulations is lax, and from July to September when Moroccans resident abroad return from Europe by car in large numbers. \nTraffic Laws:  In the event of a traffic accident, including accidents involving injuries, the parties are required to remain at the scene and not move their vehicles until the police have arrived and documented all necessary information. The police emergency services telephone number is “190”. Often Moroccan police officers pull over drivers for inspection within the city and on highways. \nTraffic Fines:  Confiscation of a driver’s license is possible if a violator is unable or unwilling to settle a fine at the time of a traffic stop. \nIf you are stopped for a speeding violation, you have the right to request the video footage documenting the infraction. Once the speeding violation is confirmed, you have three options:  \n\nForeign driver’s licenses are valid for use in Morocco for up to one year. After that, foreign residents must pass the Moroccan driver’s test and obtain a Moroccan driver’s license. The test is conducted in Arabic and French. Speakers of other languages are allowed to have a sworn translator with them when taking the test.\nPublic Transportation:  While public buses and taxis are inexpensive, driving habits are poor, and buses are frequently overcrowded. City buses are not considered safe. The train system has a good safety record. Trains, while sometimes crowded, are comfortable and generally on time. See our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit Morocco’s  National Tourism  website for additional information.\nWeb-based ride-sharing services are not legal in Morocco; however, some well-known companies (UBER and Careem) have attempted operations with limited success. Media reports of ride-sharing drivers being harassed and assaulted by regular taxi drivers were common.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Morocco’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Morocco’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Morocco should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at  www.marad.dot.gov/msci . Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website (https://homeport.uscg.mil), and the NGA broadcast warnings website  https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal  (select “broadcast warnings”)."

Please note an invitation letter is still required.***\nVaccinations:\nPlease read the full  Travel Advisory  for Mozambique.\nRoad travel outside the city after dark is dangerous. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling outside the major cities after dark by car, and are encouraged not to travel outside the city alone. You should be vigilant when you travel in Mozambique and if you travel to/from South Africa, as both countries have high crime rates.\nCrime:  Street crimes, including mugging, purse-snatching, and pick-pocketing are common in Maputo and in secondary cities. Carjackings are rare, but still occur.\nJohannesburg International Airport:\nLandmines:  Mozambique was declared free of all known landmines in 2015; however, there could remain unknown mines in very rural areas. Seek local information before going off-road outside major cities.\nInformation about  specific safety and security issues  can be found on the U.S. Embassy Maputo’s  website . \n \n Victims of Crime:\nReport crimes to the local police and contact the U.S. Embassy at +258 21-49-0723. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes. \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nFraud:  The U.S. Embassy in Maputo has received reports of scams which originate online, and involve promises of large inheritances that require international travel. Victims of this type of scam are asked to deliver suitcases from one location to another, and become unwitting narcotics traffickers. Be skeptical about financial promises made by an online contact, and never carry anything that you did not pack yourself.\nSee the  Department of State  page for more information on scams. \nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.  There is some tourism infrastructure, often operated by expatriates, but the host government has limited capacity to regulate.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified, either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the relevant field.  In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical treatment, especially outside normal working hours.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to host country laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be deported, arrested or imprisoned.  It’s very important to know what’s legal and what’s not wherever you go.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information. \n \n Faith-Based Travelers:  See the  Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report . \n \n LGB Travelers:  Mozambique is a very tolerant society. Consensual same-sex relations are not criminalized and there is increasing space in public conversation regarding LGB issues. There remains, however, some societal stigmatization and room for progress in terms of full equal treatment, such as in the registration of LGB groups. See   our   LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details. \n \n Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:   Although the government legislatively mandates access to public buildings, transportation, and government services for persons with disabilities, few buildings are accessible.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:\nConsult the  CDC website for the Mozambique  prior to travel. \n \nMedical facilities are rudimentary, and most medical providers do not speak fluent English. Medications are not always available.  Public and private medical facilities exist in the city of Maputo and most provincial capitals.\nMedical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage. We strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation. \nVaccinations : Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information :\n \nRoad Conditions and Safety : The EN4 toll road between Maputo and South Africa is well-maintained. The road network connecting provincial capitals is in fair condition, but can be riddled with potholes and other obstacles. Vehicles on certain sections of the EN1 roadway in Sofala and Manica provinces and the EN6 between Beira and Chimoio have been shot at and the Government of Mozambique has instituted convoys on some stretches of the road. U.S. Embassy officials are restricted from traveling in Sofala or Manica on the EN1 between the Save River (in the south) and the city of Caia (in the north) and on the EN6 between Beira and Chimoio. Restrictions are also in place on the EN7 from Nova Vanduzi to Luenha.    \nAccidents  Serious traffic accidents are one of the greatest threats to U.S. citizens in Mozambique. Accidents involving drivers and pedestrians are common and sometimes fatal. The potential for accidents increases at night due to unseen holes and obstructions, poor lighting conditions, pedestrians on the highways, and other vehicles driving without headlights. If a serious accident occurs or if a driver hits a pedestrian, crowds quickly gather.\nTraffic Laws :   Drivers should obey police signals to stop at checkpoints, which are common throughout Mozambique. Foreigners visiting Mozambique for more than 90 days are required to have an International Driver’s License or to obtain a Mozambican driver’s license. \n \n Public Transportation : The U.S. Embassy advises U.S. citizens not to use “ chapas ” (local minibuses) as a method of transportation due to frequent, often fatal accidents involving these vehicles. \n \nSee our  Road Safety  page for more information. Visit the website of  Mozambique’s national tourist office . \n \n Aviation Safety Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Mozambique, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Mozambique’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page ."

Birth certificates should be original or certified copies of the original. When one parent is traveling alone with a child, he or she should present the unabridged birth certificate, plus a notarized consent from the other parent listed on the birth certificate authorizing him or her to enter/depart from Namibia with the child. Alternatively, the parent could also present a court order granting him or her full legal custody of the child, or the death certificate of the other parent named on the birth certificate. \nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to, or foreign residents of Namibia. Find information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nRoad Travel:   Namibia has thousands of miles of unpaved roads. Road accidents, particularly on gravel roads, pose the most serious threat to visitors. Many gravel roads are well-maintained and can provide unaccustomed drivers a false sense of security, with road conditions shifting dramatically in certain areas. See recommendations below on road safety in Namibia. \nCrime:   Non-violent crimes of opportunity are the most common incidents reported by foreigners and include pick pocketing, purse snatching, ATM card skimming, and vehicle thefts and break-ins. Criminals sometimes brandish knives and guns. Violent crimes, including murder and rape, and property crimes increased in Windhoek over the last year. Robberies occur at roadside rest stops. \nTransport crimes:  Violent assaults on taxi passengers are known to occur; petty theft is prevalent and occurs on trains, buses, and in taxis. \nCheckpoints:  The police maintain checkpoints approximately 9 miles (15 km) outside of main cities and all major highways. During the holiday season, additional checkpoints may be established along the Windhoek-Swakopmund highway (B1). \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI   pages for information. \nVictims of Crime:   U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 112 and contact the U.S. Embassy at + (264) (61) 295-8522. \nTourist Protection Units (TPUs) assist tourists victimized by crime in Windhoek and Swakopmund. \nPlease contact: \nLocal authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . \nWe can: \nDomestic Violence:   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. \nTourism:   The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:   You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.   \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. \nDiamonds:   Do not purchase diamonds and other protected resources outside of licensed retail establishments. If you are convicted of illegally dealing in diamonds, you can face up to 20,000 U.S. dollars in fines and/or five years in prison.  \nWild animal parts:   Unlicensed purchase of or trading in endangered wildlife parts, such as ivory and rhino horn, is illegal and carries severe penalties including fines up to 1.1 million U.S. dollars and 15 years in prison. Furthermore, it is illegal to kill or capture any protected wild animals without appropriate permits.  \nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information. \nPhotography:   It is illegal to take pictures of government buildings, military installations, and key infrastructure, such as ports, train stations, airports, and along border areas. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of people without their permission. \nPhone Service:   Cellular phones are the norm, as landlines are only in urban areas. It is possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone. \nCurrency:   The Namibian dollar (NAD) is the official currency. It is pegged to the South African rand, which is also legal tender in Namibia. Carefully inspect ATMs for skimming technology before using. Credit cards are generally accepted. \nWild Animal Parks : Heed all instructions given by guides or trackers. Use common sense and maintain a safe distance when approaching wildlife. Even in the most serene settings wild animals pose a lethal threat. Lions, leopards, elephants, oryxes, rhinos, hippos, and crocodiles have critically injured and killed individuals in the region. \nBaboons live throughout Namibia and commonly scavenge the belongings of travelers. Baboons in camping areas are quite bold in approaching and taking items that interest them; they can be aggressive.  Keep your belongings and food in secure containers. \nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information. \nAdventure activities:   Climbing areas, 4X4 trails, hiking trails, and rivers are unpredictable and dangerous. They are often located in isolated areas without access to communications and away from any medical assistance. Dozens of people, including U.S. citizens, have been injured or drowned. \nFaith-Based Travelers:   See our following webpages for details: \nLGB Travelers:   Homosexuality is not illegal but sodomy between men is criminalized, though the ban is not enforced. Many Namibians consider all same-sex sexual activity taboo. \nSee our   LGB  Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details. \nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Namibia prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities and information to services. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication and general infrastructure. Contact the US Embassy in Namibia to receive a list of providers. \nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips.\nWomen Travelers:  There are frequent reports of rapes, particularly in informal settlements. Only a small fraction of rape cases are prosecuted and fewer still result in conviction. Gender-based Violence Protection Units intervene in cases of domestic violence, which is widespread. Units are staffed with police officers, social workers, legal advisors, and medical personnel trained to assist victims of sexual assault. A privately run shelter operates in the Khomas region and there are government shelters in other regions. \nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers . \nConsult the  CDC website for Namibia  prior to travel. \nMedical facilities in the capital of Windhoek and in large towns are capable of providing emergency care and performing many routine procedures. Doctors and dentists are generally well-trained. Well-equipped facilities are rarely available in smaller towns. Carry prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Be sure to verify with the Namibian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that your medications are legal before you travel. \nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance coverage. \nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation. \nThe following diseases are prevalent: \nUse the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.  Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.  \nHIV/AIDS:  The United States works in partnership with the Government of Namibia to fight HIV/AIDS while promoting sustainable national ownership and leadership of HIV/AIDS programs. (Through PEPFAR, USAID and the Ministry of Health and Social Services). PEPFAR is the largest commitment by a single nation towards an international health initiative and in Namibia, PEPFAR has contributed over US$1.1 billion for HIV/AIDS activities since its inception in 2003.  \nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Resources for Travelers  regarding specific issues in Namibia. \nFor emergency services in Namibia, dial Police; +264(63)10111. E-Med Rescue 24, dial 081 924 (from Cell), 061 411 600 (landline); AEMS Ambulance Services, dial 081 963 (from Cell), 061 300 118 (landline). \nAmbulance services are: \nVaccinations:\nBe up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.  \nThe air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the Spring. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: \nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nHealth facilities in general\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery \nPharmaceuticals\nWater Quality\nAltitude\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Most major roads are generally well maintained, though many rural roads are gravel and fatal accidents are not uncommon. (The road from Windhoek to Swakopmund is paved, but also the site of many fatal accidents, particularly between Usakos and Arandis).  Tourists are often involved in single vehicle roll-over accidents. Sand, salt, and gravel roads become very slippery when wet and more dangerous at night. Animals easily visible by day become treacherous hazards in roadways at night. Do not exceed 45 mph (80km) on gravel roads. Many rental vehicle agencies void insurance policies if an accident occurs while speeding. Tire punctures are common as are accidents involving drunk drivers. Other driving hazards include excessive speed, lack of street lighting and shoulders, inadequately maintained vehicles, erratic driving habits, and pedestrians. \nThe Embassy does not recommend traveling after dark anywhere outside Namibia’s cities. Travel in desert areas or via the Trans-Caprivi Highway between Rundu and Katima Mulilo should only be undertaken during daylight hours. Carry water, additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Fuel availability can be sporadic. Professional roadside assistance outside Windhoek or off main roads is unreliable or non-existent. \nTraffic Laws:  Traffic drives on the left. You may use a U.S. license for up to 90 days or obtain an international driving permit prior to leaving the United States through either the American Automobile Association or the American Automobile Touring Alliance. It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving. Seat belts are required for all vehicle occupants. Motorcyclists are required to wear protective helmets. You may face a charge of culpable homicide if you are driving and are involved in an accident resulting in death. \nMotorcades:  Pull to the side of the road as far as possible and promptly follow instructions given by the officials present. \nPublic Transportation:  Public transportation is not widely available outside the capital. Taxis and municipal buses are the only forms of public transportation in Windhoek. Schedules and routes are limited. \nAvoid the use of public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Any form of public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. \nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of Namibia’s  national tourist office  and national  authority responsible for road safety.\nTaxis:  The Embassy has received reports of foreign citizens being robbed by drivers of taxis hailed on the streets of Windhoek. Car rentals or radio taxis (taxi service called in advance through established companies) are generally the best means of transport but may be more expensive. The Embassy has not received any such crime reports regarding radio taxis. U.S. citizens are urged to avoid hitchhiking in Namibia due to the high level of personal risk. \nMost insurance policies will not cover accidents that do not involve other vehicles or animals. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Namibia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Namibia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page . \nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Namibia should also check for U.S.  maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings website  select “broadcast warnings”. "

Visas will only be given in 15-, 30-, or 90-day increments, but may be extended at the Department of Immigration offices. \nThe visa fees at the airport and checkpoints are: \nVisa fees are payable in U.S. dollars. Money exchanges and ATM services are available at the airport. Credit cards may also be accepted at the airport.\nOther Visa Categories: As of February 2025, foreign travelers must arrive in Nepal on a tourist visa and can only convert their visa to a different category after arrival.  Check with the  Department of Immigration  for visa details and the online applications, including student and work visas. Your purpose of travel will dictate what category of visa you will need. If you intend to apply for a study or work visa from Nepal, you should start the visa conversion process with the institution/employer and the concerned government authorities at least two months prior to expiration of your tourist visa.  Non-tourist visa issuance has been known to take months to process and stays beyond 150 days on a tourist visa will lead to deportation with overstay fines and penalties.\nExtending Your Visa:\nRequirements for Exit:\nTravel across the Nepal-China Border:  You must obtain a special permit for tourist travel to Tibet. Chinese authorities may require U.S. citizens and other foreign tourists to organize \"group\" tours through established travel agencies as a prerequisite for obtaining visas and entry permits into Tibet. For current regulations on entry into Tibet, please read the  Department of State’s travel information for China .\nCurrency and Money Issues : Travelers must declare the import or export of currency that exceeds $5,000 USD via a customs declaration form. Travelers should keep a copy of the declaration form after customs officials have put the official endorsement and appropriate stamps on the form to prevent any problems upon departure. Please note that this requirement is subject to change and travelers should contact the  Embassy of Nepal in Washington, D.C.  for the latest information. Carrying Indian currency in denominations greater than 100 rupees notes is illegal/restricted in Nepal. Travelers coming to Nepal from India who hope to change Indian currency into Nepali Rupees are advised to bring 100 Indian Rupee notes or lower denominations only. Nepali Rupees cannot be exchanged outside of Nepal.\nCustoms:  Nepal customs regulations  are complex. Customs authorities enforce strict regulations concerning importation (even temporarily) and exportation of certain items. Do not carry valuable metals, articles of archaeological or religious significance, wildlife or related items, drugs, or weapons and ammunition. Do extensive research before importing household pets (including cats and dogs), communications equipment, and other items that might be perceived as sensitive. Drones are strictly regulated throughout Nepal and require special permission from the Home Ministry and other government authorities. \nDual Nationality : Nepal does not recognize dual nationality. Accordingly, when a Nepali citizen naturalizes as a U.S. citizen, he/she loses his/her Nepali citizenship. Some travelers who have tried to maintain both U.S. and Nepali passports have faced difficulties entering or exiting Nepal. U.S. citizens of Nepali descent may be eligible for a special visa called a “Non-Resident Nepali” or “NRN” Identity Card. The NRN Identity Card allows a holder to open a local bank account, invest, and own certain types of property, subject to certain restrictions.

Demonstrations have on occasion turned violent, although these activities generally have not been directed at U.S. citizens. \nCrime:  Crime is relatively low throughout the country. Pickpocketing and bag-snatching can happen at popular tourist spots. Store valuables, including passports and cash, in the hotel safety deposit box; do not carry them. The Nepal Tourist Police recommend that you carry a photocopy of your passport when going out. \nScams:  Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Nepal.  Review the Department of State’s  Protecting Yourself from Scams  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, update all software (operating system and apps). If possible, use a virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S.-based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi. \nGPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. The GPS app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.\nBe careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.  \nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of crime in Nepal are encouraged to  contact the U.S. Embassy  in Kathmandu for assistance.\nReport crimes to the local police by dialing 100 as soon as the incident occurs. This number is equivalent to 911, and it is staffed 24/7 by the local police.

Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.  \nSee our webpage on help for  U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nFor other emergencies: \nDial  101  to report a fire. \n Dial  102  for ambulance services.\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place on any level.  Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk.  Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country.  U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.  See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don’t know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on        crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to  notify  the U.S. Embassy immediately. If you are arrested in Nepal, the authorities may keep you in detention for weeks or even longer during the investigation stage. See our  webpage  for further information.\nDriving Under the Influence:  Driving in Nepal after consuming any amount of alcohol could result in arrest.\nIllicit Drugs:  Purchasing, possessing, or consuming illegal drugs, including marijuana and hashish, could result in both fines and jail time.\nFirearms and Ammunition:  You may not bring any kind of firearm or ammunition into Nepal. Violators who bring in firearms or ammunition—even imitations or in jewelry form—may be prosecuted.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. \nSee the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website  and  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  Religious conversion and proselytization are illegal in Nepal. See the following webpages for details:\nInternational Volunteers:\nNepal’s Department of Immigration considers volunteering as work and thus requires volunteers to obtain a work visa.  Volunteering on a tourist visa is illegal , and can result in detention by immigration authorities, fines, expulsion from Nepal, and lengthy bans on returning to Nepal.\nThere has been occasional fraud associated with some charities in Nepal.  If you are not certain about an organization, you may want to consider routing contributions through a reputable national or international charity to avoid the possibility that your time and money could unknowingly support the exploitation of children.\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Nepal. Same-sex sexual activity is not criminalized, and LGB persons in Nepal actively and openly advocate for their rights. Nepal, however, remains a conservative and traditional society. Discrimination exists, and reports of non-violent harassment of LGB persons have been received. Accordingly, LGB travelers may wish to be discreet and avoid public displays of affection.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Nepal prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Expect accessibility to be limited throughout Nepal. Nepali law requires access to buildings, transportation, and other services, but poor infrastructure often makes it difficult for people with mobility issues to get around, even within the Kathmandu Valley. Apart from a few clinics and hospitals, Nepal generally lacks accessible and suitable accommodations for individuals with disabilities.\nSee our  Travelers with Disabilities  page.\nStudents:  See the  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See the travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nSPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nTREKKING IN NEPAL\nDO NOT TREK ALONE:  The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu  strongly discourages  U.S. citizens from hiking alone or even separating from larger traveling parties while on a trail. The safest option for trekkers is to join an organized group and/or use a reputable trekking company that provides an experienced guide and porters who communicate in both Nepali and English.\nRequirements established by the Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) and more than a dozen trekking organizations, with the support of Nepal’s Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation,  require solo or foreign independent trekkers to use a local licensed guide while trekking in Nepal’s official national parks and protected areas.  Failure to comply with this requirement may result in considerable fines. Please review travel related information on the official websites of the  Nepal Tourism Board  and the  U.S. Embassy Kathmandu  prior to travel. Provide family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to trekking and check in at all police checkpoints where trekking permits are logged.  Register your itinerary  with the U.S. Embassy through the STEP enrollment process.\nNatural Disaster Risks:  Trekkers should be alert to the possibility of avalanches, landslides, and falling rocks, even when trails are clear. Earthquakes can destabilize mountainous areas, causing severe landslides. Flooding during monsoon season also increases the risk of landslides.\nAltitude Risks: Follow medical advice regarding high altitude mountain sickness.  Everyone, regardless of age, experience, or fitness level, should exercise caution when trekking at high altitudes. Many popular trekking routes in Nepal cross passes as high as 18,000 feet. Only experienced mountain climbers should tackle the Himalayas.   Acclimatization is best achieved by walking slowly, rather than hurrying, at high altitudes. Without acclimatization, trekkers can experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), which can be deadly. Speak with your doctor for specific recommendations. We strongly recommend supplemental travel and evacuation insurance.\nEvacuation by Helicopter:  Obtain emergency medical  evacuation  insurance  before visiting Nepal. Many foreigners require or request evacuation by helicopter from Nepal’s rugged mountain terrain. Helicopter companies will generally require either specific evacuation insurance, pre-approval from your health insurance, or payment upfront by credit card to assist. Carry appropriate insurance and travel with credit card information. If you want your health insurance to cover large bills without pre-approval, be aware that the service provider might keep your passport until they receive payment. Beware of medevac scams, which can occur in Nepal.  Trekkers should use only evacuation agencies registered with the  Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal (TAAN)  and find out the costs for evacuations beforehand.\nLodging and Travel:  During peak trekking seasons make advance booking for hotel rooms and plan for possible flight/airport delays. Domestic air flight cancellations and delays occur frequently because of bad weather. Leave ample time to catch outbound international flights when connecting from domestic flights. Be aware that many hotels in Nepal do not meet international fire or earthquake safety standards. \nTIMS Card and Trekking Permits:  Foreign visitors on hiking trips in Nepal, including those not with organized hiking groups, are required to have a valid TIMS card through authorized trekking agencies registered with the Government of Nepal. In case of an emergency, this system helps authorities find trekkers.\nSpecial Permits for Restricted Areas:  Trekking in certain remote areas of Nepal and in national parks may require additional permits or fees. Travelers may consult with an experienced tour agency or review the website of the  Nepali Department of Immigration  for more information. Please be aware that restricted areas have special requirements for helicopter rescue flights, which may delay assistance even in the event of a medical emergency.\nNatural Disasters:  Nepal is at high risk for major earthquakes. The country lacks adequate emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities, and building codes are not strictly enforced. Nepal is also prone to flooding and landslides. The Government of Nepal may have limited ability to respond to natural disasters. For general information on disaster preparedness, visit the  U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) .\nGeneral:  Medical care outside the Kathmandu valley may be limited and not up to U.S. standards. Medical facilities can lack resources. Similarly, mental health care outside of Kathmandu may be limited, and U.S. citizens with mental health problems are usually stabilized and transported to the United States or a regional center for care at their own expense. The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu maintains a  list of local medical facilities and practitioners .\nFor emergency services in Nepal,  dial 102 .\nAmbulance services are:\nSee our  Health Abroad page  for more information.\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Travel Insurance page  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nSerious medical issues and injuries suffered while hiking in remote areas may require evacuation by helicopter to Kathmandu. Those trekking in remote areas of Nepal should factor the high cost of a potential helicopter rescue into their financial considerations. Medical evacuations can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Payment will be expected in cash before the medevac can take place, if there is no insurance coverage. Neither the U.S. Embassy nor the U.S. government pays private medical bills overseas.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Nepal Public Health Foundation  to ensure the medication is legal in Nepal.\nVaccinations:  Stay up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended  by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy:  Assisted Reproductive Technology services are widely available in Nepal and are generally safe. Surrogacy is illegal for foreigners in Nepal and is subject to complex local regulations. Individuals who attempt to circumvent local law risk criminal prosecution. For additional information, visit the  U.S. Embassy in Nepal  website.\nStray Animals : Stray animals are common on the streets of Kathmandu and at popular tourist sites. Stray animals may be infected with rabies. The CDC’s  Preventing Dog Bites  webpage recommends that if you are bitten by an animal, get to a safe place, immediately wash wounds with soap and water, and seek medical attention.\nPharmaceuticals:  To avoid problems at port of entry, always carry prescribed medication in the original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Embassy of Nepal  to ensure that the medication is legal in Nepal. Local authorities irregularly enforce restrictions on certain drugs regularly prescribed by doctors in the United States or other foreign countries.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back.  The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States.  Visit the websites of  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and the  Food and Drug Administration  for more information.\nWater Quality & Food Safety:  Outside of Kathmandu, intestinal tract diseases, including cholera, are present. Sanitary food handling practices may not be on par with practices in the United States, and precautions should be taken to prevent water and food-borne illnesses. Travelers should avoid raw, green, leafy vegetables during the monsoon season because of the risk of cyclospora.\nIn many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe You should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates and ZephAir for additional locations.\nAir pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in Nepal. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. Consult your doctor before traveling if necessary. \nTravelers with asthma, allergies, heart disease, or environmental sensitivities are more likely to be affected and may want to bring their required medications. \nRoad Conditions and Safety : In Nepal, vehicles are driven on the left-hand side of the road. In general, roads in Nepal are in poor condition and lack basic safety features, resulting in significant numbers of accidents and fatalities. Traffic is poorly regulated, and traffic jams are common on major streets. Many drivers are neither properly licensed nor trained, vehicles are poorly maintained, and public vehicles are often overloaded.\nNepali law requires that you have a valid Nepali license to legally operate a motor vehicle in Nepal. If you drive without a valid local license, you will expose yourself to greater legal liability. The Nepal Department of Transportation does not convert U.S. driver’s license into a Nepali license. Foreign nationals must either pass the driving test in Nepal or obtain an online International Driving Permit.\nTraffic Laws : U.S. citizens involved in an accident in Nepal should call 103, the traffic hotline. Police will investigate if necessary to determine the guilty party in an accident with injury or vehicle damage. In cases of severe injury or death you may want to hire a local attorney as charges may be filed. Drivers should either have an international license or Nepali license on them when driving. All vehicles must be insured. To make an insurance claim you will need a police report. If stopped by civil police, they may request to see travel documents, such as a passport.\nMonsoon Impact on Trekker Safety:  Many monsoon-related deaths and injuries are reported each year in Nepal. Monsoon Season generally begins in June and ends in September. Monsoons destabilize mountainsides and cause flooding. Landslides and mudslides caused by monsoons frequently damage trails and roads, injuring or killing passengers in vehicles, and causing road blockages that may take considerable time to repair, stranding travelers. Remote airports in mountainous areas are sometimes closed for multiple days (or even weeks) during inclement weather, which can force travelers to choose between lengthy delays or hazardous roads or trails. Monsoon rains may also complicate efforts to locate U.S. citizens and arrange medical evacuations.\nNighttime Travel:  Avoid nighttime road travel outside major cities because of insufficient street lighting and hazardous road conditions. Embassy personnel are prohibited from traveling at night outside urban areas in Nepal.\nMotorcycle Travel:  Deaths from motorcycle accidents have risen dramatically in recent years, including in Kathmandu. Always wear a helmet, particularly on highways.\nBuses:  Long-distance buses often drive recklessly, and bus accidents involving fatalities are not uncommon. It is dangerous to travel on the roofs of buses as live electrical and other communications wires hang low in many places. Traffic police also impose fines and detain individuals for riding on the roofs of buses.\nTaxis:  Taxis are a safer and more convenient alternative to buses. Almost all taxi drivers in Nepal insist on negotiating the price of the trip in advance, even if the taxi has a meter installed. Online apps for taxis, such as Pathao, are widely used.\nPedestrian Travel:  Sidewalks are nonexistent in many areas, and drivers generally do not yield the right-of-way to pedestrians. Pedestrians account for a considerable portion of traffic fatalities in Nepal.\nSee our  Road Safety  page for more information.\nVisit the website of Nepal’s  national tourist office  and national authority responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight: \nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Nepal’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s  website  includes more information on its assessment program.\nDomestic air safety is a concern. In recent years, there have been several fatal plane crashes on domestic routes in Nepal, including some crashes in which U.S. citizens have been killed. Nepal’s mountain airports, including Lukla and Jomsom, are notoriously dangerous due to challenging weather and terrain. As a result of Nepal’s poor aviation safety record, since 2013 the European Union (EU) has banned all Nepali airlines from flying into or within EU countries. Although Nepali domestic flights are insured, payments to the families of victims of a plane crash are minimal. Domestic air travelers may want to consider flight insurance that will cover domestic flights in Nepal before leaving home. Check  Nepal’s air safety profile  with the Aviation Safety Network."

Avoid leaving valuables in automobiles, especially electronic devices, such as laptops, tablets, GPS devices, and mobile telephones. Never leave your personal items or baggage unattended.\nMost retailers in the Netherlands only accept a “chip and pin” card and will not accept a standard U.S. credit card containing only a magnetic strip.

    "advisory_text": "U.S. Embassy Managua\nKm 5 ½ Carretera Sur \n Managua, Nicaragua \n Telephone:  +(505) 2252-7100 \n  Emergency After-Hours Telephone:  +(505) 2252-7100 \n  Fax:  +(505) 2252-7250 \n  Email:   ACSManagua@state.gov\nEmail:   ACSManagua@state.gov\nLearn about the U.S. relationship to countries around the world.\nThe Government of Nicaragua has denied entry to and expelled U.S. citizens. This includes dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens and individuals that previously traveled to/from Nicaragua without incident. The government targets real or perceived opponents to the Government of Nicaragua. Those targeted include:\nThe Nicaraguan government has revoked foreigners’ residency status. It has revoked status for actions or expressions it perceives as political. The government has arrested, denied permission to travel, and prevented individuals from leaving the country for political reasons. Immigration authorities regularly review social media for evidence of political expression or activity and warn against such activities. \nRequirements for Entry:   To enter Nicaragua, you need a U.S. passport that is valid for your length of stay. All visitors must pay  $10 USD  in cash for a tourist entry stamp upon arrival (exact change is recommended.). The stamp is valid for up to 90 days.\nRequirements for Exit:\nMinors:  See the  U.S. Embassy website  for information regarding departure requirements for children under 18 who also are Nicaraguan citizens.\nProhibited Items:  Drones and similar devices are prohibited. They will be seized by customs authorities upon arrival. Customs may also seize photography equipment, videography equipment, and binoculars. There is no mechanism to retrieve these items later. Nicaraguan government authorities may also search personal phones, computers, electronics, and documents for anti-government content. They also sometimes seize such private property. For more information, see “Customs Regulations” below. Additionally, the transportation of arms or items that may be considered law enforcement or military equipment is strictly prohibited without written approval from the Nicaraguan government. Do not transport any arms or items that may be considered law enforcement or military equipment. Such items include, but are not limited to:  \nAll U.S. citizens, including U.S. government, military, and contractor personnel found to be carrying such items, even in the smallest quantities, will be arrested and face strict criminal penalties. Penalties including imprisonment, large monetary fines, forfeiture of the items, and deportation. This is regardless of whether airlines and/or U.S. authorities allowed the items shipment on a U.S.-originating flight.\nAdvanced Coordination Required for Volunteer Groups:   Please note that since 2018 the Government of Nicaragua has closed more than 5,300 NGOs and charitable organizations, including religious organizations. Groups engaged in these types of activities, including the apolitical provision of basic services, may be denied entry.  You should email both the Nicaraguan Embassy in the United States ( asistente.emb@embanic.org ) and the Nicaraguan Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( enlace@cancilleria.gob.ni ) to inform them of your trip and secure advance permission if you are leading one of the following types of trips, even if your group has worked in Nicaragua previously or has a local office:\nIMPORTANT:  Even with a visit approval, the Government of Nicaragua may rescind the decision without advance notice.\nFor the latest visa and entry requirements, visit the  Nicaraguan Immigration website  (Spanish only).\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:   The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors or foreign residents in Nicaragua.\nDual Nationality and International Parental Child Abduction:   Find information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nCOVID-19 Information:  Travelers arriving in Nicaragua do not need to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.\nThe Government of Nicaragua is authoritarian. It limits freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. It represses internal dissent, and it monitors and responds to perceived threats to its authority. Nicaragua’s Sovereign Security Law and its Terrorism and Money Laundering Law allow for discretionary interpretation of often vaguely defined unlawful activities. For example, threatening the peace and economic stability of Nicaragua. Convictions under these laws have often been arbitrary. They result in long prison sentences and loss of assets (money and property). They also result in deportations with bans on returning to Nicaragua.\nNicaraguan authorities and armed civilians in plain clothes known as “para police” may monitor, detain, deny entry to, expel, or question U.S. citizens concerning their activities. This includes U.S. citizen contact with Nicaraguan citizens. Visitors should avoid any commentary on Nicaraguan politics or governance.\nThe Nicaraguan government may detain or expel individuals for activities that would not be considered criminal or offensive in the United States. Nicaraguan authorities have subjected U.S. citizens, including dual U.S.-Nicaraguan citizens, to prolonged detentions. The detentions are often politically motivated or arbitrary. Especially in politically motivated arrests, the judicial process has regularly been criticized as neither fair nor transparent.\nDemonstrations or strikes may occur throughout the country; in the past, the Nicaraguan government has violently suppressed them. Avoid demonstrations, and exercise extreme caution around large gatherings.\nRoads may be closed, and public transportation may be disrupted due to large crowds celebrating the following holidays:\nCrime:  Vehicle burglaries, pick-pocketing, and occasional armed robberies occur in store parking lots, on public transportation, and in open-air markets like the Oriental and Huembes Markets in Managua. Petty street crime is common. Police presence is limited outside of major urban areas. The Caribbean coast’s geographical isolation further limits the U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens living in or visiting the area.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  page for information.\nVictims of Crime:   Report crimes, including sexual assault, to the local police at 118 (Nicaraguan equivalent of “911,” in Spanish). Report serious crimes to the U.S. Embassy at 2252-7100 immediately and minor crimes during business hours.\nThe U.S. Embassy can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\nCoastal Disputes:  Be aware of the following border disputes:\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities are uncommon. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in major cities. In the event of a diving injury, the only hyperbaric chamber is in Puerto Cabezas, over 100 miles from Corn Island where most tourists dive. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on  insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nBeach Safety:  Exercise extreme caution at the beach. Strong undertows and currents make swimming in Nicaragua’s Pacific Coast extremely dangerous. This is true, even for experienced swimmers. U.S. citizens have drowned at Nicaraguan beaches, and in lagoons and lakes. Warning signs are not always posted. Lifeguards and rescue equipment are not normally available, and Nicaragua’s search and rescue capabilities are limited. Surfers and swimmers have been struck by boats at Nicaraguan beaches. This has resulted in serious injury and death. Carefully assess the potential risks of recreational water activities. Consider your physical capabilities and skills before swimming. Be aware that drinking alcohol and swimming can be a deadly combination.\nHiking in volcanic or remote areas is dangerous. Wear appropriate clothing and footwear. Carry sufficient food, water, and communication equipment. If you travel to remote areas, hire a reputable local guide. Nicaraguan law requires tourists to hire a local guide for most volcanic hikes. This includes the two volcanoes on Ometepe Island (Maderas and Concepcion).\nDisaster Preparedness:  Nicaragua is prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. Plan for seeking emergency care, shelter, or evacuation routes. Many remote locations in the country lack good cell phone coverage.\n \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate Nicaraguan law, even unknowingly, you may be fined, expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. There are severe penalties, including imprisonment, for domestic violence, psychological abuse, and non-payment of child support. Furthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  Nicaraguan authorities do not always notify the U.S. Embassy when a U.S. citizen has been arrested or detained. This is especially true if the arrestee has dual nationality. If you are arrested or detained, ask both police and prison officials and friends and family to notify the U.S. Embassy. After the U.S. Embassy learns of an arrest, it may be several days or weeks before the Government of Nicaragua permits a consular official to visit. In the case of dual U.S.-Nicaraguan nationals, the U.S. Embassy may be denied consular access. See our  webpage  for further information.\nDrug and Alcohol Enforcement:  Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Nicaragua are severe. This includes charges for possession of small amounts of illegal drugs. Even with a prescription, marijuana is illegal in Nicaragua.\nPurchasing Property:  Be extremely cautious of investing in and/or buying property. Property rights and enforcement are notoriously unreliable in Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Government has confiscated privately owned land or residences without warning. They do so without due process or compensation. Armed individuals have taken over privately-owned land. The Nicaraguan authorities may decline to evict those who illegally take possession of private property. U.S. citizens have been arrested or threatened over property disputes. See  our website  for more information.\nCustoms Regulations:  U.S. citizens planning to import items should contract a recognized local customs broker for assistance well in advance of their visit. The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist with the customs or import process.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:   There are no legal restrictions on same-sex relations or the organization of LGB events in Nicaragua. While violence against LGB travelers is uncommon, widespread discrimination exists. See   our  LGB Travel Information  page and the  Department of State’s Human Rights report for further details .\nNon-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):   The Government of Nicaragua has closed more than 5,300 NGOs, including religious and charitable organizations, since 2018. Employees and volunteers of NGOs and volunteers supporting NGOs may be denied entry to Nicaragua. Those in Nicaragua may be subject to investigation or expulsion. Nicaraguan Authorities have threatened U.S. citizens engaged in religious or charitable activities with arrest and opened questionable criminal investigations. Please see “Advanced Coordination Required for Volunteer Groups” above.\nPolitical and Religious Activity :  Participating in unauthorized political or religious activities, including public protests, sending electronic messages, or publishing social media critical of the government may result in detention and expulsion. It may also result in restrictions on future travel to Nicaragua.   The Nicaraguan government has canceled large-scale religious events on short notice and has threatened organizers of these events with arrest. This has happened even after having originally permitted the activity to take place.  \nSocial Media:   Social media accounts may be monitored by the Government of Nicaragua. Nicaraguan authorities may deny entry to, investigate, or expel people whose social media accounts contain content they deem critical of the government, controversial, or that might involve illegal activity.\nSending Mail and/or Money to/from Nicaragua:   You should expect that all your mail will be opened, reviewed, and catalogued by Nicaraguan authorities. Nicaraguan Customs authorities routinely intercept, review, and retain checks, money, and debit/credit cards shipped to Nicaragua through international couriers.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  There is limited or no accessibility assistance for public transportation and in many public areas. There are few sidewalks and pedestrian road crossings. Nicaraguan law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities. However, such discrimination is widespread in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of state services.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page.\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nPublic and private hospitals in Nicaragua do not meet U.S. standards. Many hospitals are understaffed. Some hospitals may not be able to assist in emergencies. Only basic, limited emergency medical services are available outside Managua. Physicians and hospital personnel frequently do not speak English.  \nManagua has a sole private hospital that is JCAHO  ( Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations)  certified, with labs and radiology services available, though it has a very limited number of specialists for acute emergencies. Medical services outside Managua are limited, including for victims of crime. Government hospitals are understaffed and some hospitals throughout the country may not be able to assist in emergencies. Private hospitals and physicians expect up-front payment. This can be done with cash or credit card.\nAmbulance services are not widely available. Training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. Ambulances are not equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. They provide transportation and basic first aid only.\nThe Department of State does not pay medical bills nor medical evacuation (air ambulance) costs. U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Even with health insurance, most care providers overseas require cash payments prior to providing service. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. Medical evacuation costs to the United States from Nicaragua can be expensive. It starts at $15,000 and goes up to $100,000 or more. The cost depends on the destination and level of care required.   \nIf traveling with prescription medication, review the  Nicaraguan Ministry of Health's Pharmacy Department  web guidance page on entering with pharmaceuticals products. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging labeled with your doctor’s prescribing information.\nTap water is not reliably potable. Drink only purified bottled water.\nThe following  diseases  are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Main roads between major cities are generally paved and in good condition. Other roads may have potholes, lack shoulders, be poorly lit and narrow. Speed bumps are often poorly marked. During the rainy season, roads may become flooded or have additional damage. Horse carts, livestock, and pedestrians crossing roads in front of oncoming traffic are common. This happens even on major roads in the main cities. Most roads on the Caribbean coast are unpaved. Road signs throughout the country are limited or non-existent. Road travel after dark is hazardous in all areas. Carry a cellphone in case of emergency. However, understand cell reception may be spotty in many areas of the country. Do not drive outside urban areas after dark.\nTraffic Laws:    If you are involved in a traffic accident, you must wait for the police and insurance company representatives to arrive before you move your vehicle.  However, especially during overnight hours, police and insurance companies may not respond. Do not move your vehicle until a police officer tells you to do so. Otherwise, you may be legally liable for the accident. If you receive a traffic violation, police may take your driver’s license until you pay the fine. Depending on your length of stay, you may not recover your license in a timely manner.\nNicaraguan law requires that police take a driver into custody for:\nTo avoid liability, consider hiring a professional driver through a reputable hotel.\nAll drivers must carry:\nThese regulations also apply to drivers in rental vehicles. Penalties for not having any of the above include fines and towing. For more information, check with the  Nicaraguan National Police  or the Embassy of Nicaragua.\nTraffic Stops:  Transit police often stop vehicles with either local or foreign license plates.\nIf transit police demand a bribe instead lieu of a fine, request a receipt and the officer’s name and badge number.\nTo report mistreatment by police, email a complaint to  Nicaragua’s National Police  and forward a copy to the  U.S. Consular Section in Managua .\nIf you receive a traffic violation, police may confiscate your driver’s license until you pay the fine. Depending on your length of stay, you may not recover your license in a timely manner.\nPublic Transportation:   Buses, moto-taxis, and ferries often lack proper safety equipment.\nAirports in remote places often have short airstrips, minimal safety equipment, and little boarding security.\nSee our  Road Safety  page for more information and the  Nicaraguan Institute of Tourism  and  National Transit Authority .\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) assessed the government of Nicaragua’s Civil Aviation Authority as compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Nicaragua’s air carrier operations in 2015. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:   Mariners planning travel to Nicaragua should check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts on the  Maritime Administration  website. Information may also be posted to the websites of the  U.S. Coast Guard  and the  National Geospatial Intelligence Agency ."

U.S. citizens should reduce exposure to locations frequented by Westerners such as restaurants and nightclubs. Visitors are urged to stay in hotels with armed Nigerien security presence.\nDue to security threats, the U.S. Embassy restricts the travel of U.S. government employees and official visitors outside of Niamey. These restrictions may limit the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist visitors in these areas.\nThe border region with Mali continues to be of specific concern. There are frequent and ongoing reports of terrorists and affiliates crossing into and through Niger from Mali. A U.S. citizen was kidnapped from the area in October 2016.\nNiger’s southeastern border with Nigeria and east of Maradi are poorly controlled. Boko Haram and several factions affiliated with ISIS have conducted cross-border attacks into Niger. The Government of Niger has increased its security forces in the border areas, but the situation remains unstable and travel is not advised.\nFor travel in any remote area of the country, the Department of State urges travelers to use guides and to travel with a minimum of two vehicles equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) and satellite phones.\nStreet demonstrations occur frequently in Niger. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning. Avoid demonstrations and maintain security awareness at all times. Refer to the  U.S. Embassy Niger website  for the most updated safety and security information.\nCrime:   Thefts and petty crimes are common day or night. Tourists should not walk alone in Niger, but areas in Niamey near the Gaweye Hotel, the National Museum, the Petit Marché, and on or near the Kennedy Bridge are of particular concern. In general, walking at night is not recommended.\nCounterfeit and pirated goods are available, but transactions involving such products may be illegal under local law. Carrying them back to the United States may result in forfeitures and/or fines.\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI   pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:\nIf you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime abroad, contact the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. There is no local equivalent to a “911” emergency line in Niger. U.S. citizens can try calling local police by dialing “17” on Nigerien phones or +227-20-72-25-53, but calls to these numbers often go unanswered, especially outside of normal working hours. The Embassy highly recommends hiring guards for your residence if you are planning to live in Niger.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on  insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There is strong societal stigma against same-sex sexual activity in Niger, but no laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual activity in general.  The law states, however, that an “unnatural act” with a person of the same sex who is under 21 is punishable by six months to three years in prison and a fine of between 9,000 and 90,000 CFA francs ($16-$160).\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our   Human Rights report  for further details.\nDress restrictions:  Local culture and Islamic tradition encourage conservative dress for both men and women. There have been incidents of groups of men assaulting women who appear to be African and who are wearing clothing other than traditional garments.\nPhotography restrictions:  Tourists are free to take pictures anywhere in Niger, except near military installations, radio and television stations, the Presidential Palace, airports, or diplomatic facilities. Tourists should not photograph military or police personnel, or political or student demonstrations, and should seek prior permission before taking a close-up “portrait” photo of an individual.\nCurrency regulations:  Niger shares the West African Franc (CFA) with several other West African countries. The CFA may be converted into dollars. Foreign currency exchange over 1 million CFA (about $1,900 at an exchange rate of about 530 CFA/$1) requires authorization from the Ministry of Finance (forms available from all major banks).\nTelephone service:  Due to poor line quality, callers often experience delays in getting a telephone line, and faxes are often unclear. Service quality is generally better with cellular service, which is available from multiple providers in urban areas. Connections between cell phones and land lines are often poor quality and may fail to connect at all.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:   Nigerien law mandates that the state provide for persons with physical and mental disabilities, but there are no specific regulations mandating accessibility to buildings, transportation, and communication for those with special needs. There is extremely limited accessibility to public transportation, road crossings, taxis, restaurants, cafes, bars, and other tourist spots.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page.\nWomen Travelers:  Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in Niger is punished by a fine and a jail sentence. Between 1998 and 2006 the practice of FGM on girls aged 15 to 49 was reduced by 50% (5% to 2.2%) although ethnic and regional disparities remain, with a pocket of the most intense FGM practice persisting in far Western Niger. Forced marriage or marriage without the consent of one or both parties still happens in Niger, and victims are often minor 15-18 year old girls. Women have limited access to education and employment (less than 15% of women can read.)\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nHealth and emergency services are extremely limited in Niamey, and completely inadequate outside the capital.  Air quality is poor in Niamey.  Travelers with respiratory conditions are cautioned that they may experience worsening symptoms in Niger.\nDocumentation of yellow fever vaccination is required for those over nine months of age upon arrival in Niger.\nMosquito borne illnesses such as malaria are the leading cause of dealth in Niger.   Documentation of yellow fever immunization is required for travelers prior to arrival in Niger.   Zika virus is a risk in Niger.  Because Zika infection in a pregnant woman can cause birth defects;  pregnant women should not visit Niger.  All travelers should follow steps to  prevent mosquito bites  and  sexual exposure  to Zika during and after the trip.\nDiarrheal illness  is quite prevalent, even in cities and luxury accommodations.  Tap water is not potable.\nWe do not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.  \nMedical Insurance:   Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.  Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments.  See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  (our webpage) to cover medical evacuation.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the Government of Niger   to ensure the medication is legal in Niger.  Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. \nThe following diseases are prevelant in Niger:\nVaccinations:   Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:    Road safety throughout Niger is a concern.  Travel outside Niamey and other cities often requires four-wheel-drive vehicles.  Driving at night is always hazardous and should be avoided. There have been occasional car-jackings and highway robberies throughout the country.\nThe main causes of accidents are driver carelessness, excessive speed, poorly maintained vehicles, and poor to non-existent road surfaces.  Urban traffic includes bicycles, pedestrians, livestock, donkey carts, and hand carts as well motor vehicles.  Overloaded trucks, buses, and other vehicles are common everywhere. Disabled vehicles are generally repaired in place, often partially blocking traffic lanes.\nPolice checkpoints are common both in cities and on rural roads.  On rural roads, police will check for license, registration, proof of insurance, and destination.\nTraffic signals in Niamey often do not work properly. Traffic signs are often missing, damaged, or obscured.\nTraffic Laws:  All drivers must have either a valid Nigerien or international driver’s license. Local liability insurance is required for all vehicles. Traffic laws are based on the French system. Unless marked otherwise, at traffic circles and intersections, traffic must yield to vehicles entering from the right.\nHeadlights should not be used during the day. Except in emergencies, only police and military vehicles are allowed to use headlights during daylight hours. Horns should not be used after dark.\nDrivers are required to pull over for: official motorcades or military convoys with headlights on, public emergency vehicles with sirens on, and funeral processions.\nAccidents involving minor damage (“fender benders”) generally only require an exchange of insurance information. However, accidents involving more serious damage or injuries, or where there is any dispute over insurance or who is at fault, will require police involvement. In any accident where the police are involved, vehicles should not be moved before the police arrive.\nPublic Transportation:   While taxis are available at a fixed fare in Niamey, most are in poor condition and do not meet basic U.S. road safety standards. Inter-city “bush-taxis” are available at negotiable fares, but these vehicles (minibuses, station wagons, and sedans) are generally older, unsafe models that are overloaded, poorly maintained, and driven by reckless operators seeking to save time and money.\nA national bus company (SNTV) operates coaches on inter-city routes and, since being reorganized in 2001, has provided reliable service and has experienced no major accidents. Air Transport, Rimbo, and Garba Messagé are private bus companies operating in Niger. Concerns exist regarding the youth of drivers and the speed with which the private buses travel the Nigerien roads.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:\nAs there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Niger, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Niger’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page ."

Common scams include:  \nVictims of Crime :  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Abuja or Consulate General in Lagos for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 112, and contact the Embassy at +(234)(9)461-4328 or Consulate General at +(234)(1) 460-3400. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nJustice in Nigeria may be uneven. Many crimes go unsolved. Others may not be prosecuted to a successful conclusion for the victim.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. citizen victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence : U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate for assistance.\nTourism : The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. Even within major cities, the limited number of first responders and extreme traffic congestion can cause lengthy delays in response time. Emergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. You should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment for serious conditions.  U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nMaritime Security : Piracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea continue to trend upwards. Pirates/armed groups operating in the region typically carry out attacks on vessels using automatic weapons. Attacks, kidnappings for ransom, and robbery of crew, passengers, and ship’s property continue to be common occurrences.\nCriminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Possession, use, or sale of cannabis and related products is prohibited under Nigerian law.  U.S. citizens who violate the law may be subject to arrest and prosecution. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General immediately. In cases where detainees are dual citizens (holders of U.S. and Nigerian citizenship), the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General may not be promptly notified. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers :  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers : Consensual, same-sex sexual relations are illegal in Nigeria. Entering same-sex marriage contracts and civil unions (defined to include “any arrangement between persons of the same sex to live together as sex partners”) is also criminalized, with punishments including fines and prison sentences of up to 14 years. Same-sex marriage contracts and civil unions entered into in a foreign country are not recognized under Nigerian law.\nPublic displays of affection between persons of the same sex are also punishable by up to ten years imprisonment. Furthermore, the law allows for the prosecution of persons who support or belong to advocacy groups relating to LGB issues, with prison sentences of up to ten years. U.S. citizens who participate in free speech or assemblies relating to same-sex marriage could potentially be prosecuted under this law.\nIn the following northern states, where Sharia law applies, penalties can also include death: Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page.\nTravelers with Disabilities:   The law in Nigeria prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities; however, the law is very unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. \nFew government buildings, schools, banks, or grocery stores have accessible facilities, including in Abuja and Lagos. Some hospitals and clinics are equally inaccessible to people with disabilities and lack wheelchair ramps or lifts, including some of the hospitals travelers commonly use. Expect accessibility to be very limited in transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, and largely absent outside of major cities. \nMuch of the disability equipment for sale locally is refurbished rather than new. Replacement parts can be found in local informal markets and are also generally refurbished parts. Imported higher-end equipment such as electric wheelchairs and lifting equipment can be purchased from a limited number of medical equipment suppliers in the major cities.\nStudents :  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers :  Rape is a crime in Nigeria. According to the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Act, rape is punishable by 12 years to life imprisonment for offenders older than 14 and a maximum of 14 years imprisonment for offenders younger than 14. Rape remains a rampant problem.\nThe VAPP Act, currently applicable only in the Federal Capital Territory, addresses sexual, physical, psychological, and socioeconomic violence, and harmful traditional practices. Federal law criminalizes female circumcision or genital mutilation (FGM/C). Twelve states have also banned FGM/C, though the practice remains common in parts of both Northern and Southern Nigeria.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nNigerian medical facilities are generally poorly equipped. Many medicines are unavailable, including medications for diabetes or asthma. Take care when purchasing medicines locally, as counterfeit pharmaceuticals are a common problem, and may be difficult to distinguish from genuine medications. Hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.\nEmergency services comparable to those in the United States or Europe are non-existent, and the blood supply is unreliable and unsafe for transfusion. For serious medical problems, you should consider traveling to the United States, Europe, or South Africa for treatment.\nFor emergency services in Nigeria, dial 112.\nAmbulance services are: \nWe do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Federal Ministry of Health  in Nigeria to ensure the medication is legal in Nigeria.\nVaccinations : Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther Health Information :\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth Facilities in General :\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery :\nPharmaceuticals :\nNon-Traditional Medicine :\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy :\nWater Quality :\nAdventure Travel :\nGeneral Health :\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nAir Quality :\nRoad Conditions and Safety : Roads are generally in poor condition, causing damage to vehicles and contributing to hazardous traffic conditions. There are few working traffic lights or stop signs, and few traffic officers to manage traffic during power outages. The rainy season, generally from May to October, is especially dangerous because of flooded roads and water-concealed potholes.\nAll drivers and passengers should wear seat belts, lock doors, and keep windows closed. You should have appropriate automobile insurance.  Drivers and passengers of vehicles involved in accidents resulting in injury or death have experienced extra-judicial actions, i.e., mob attacks, official consequences such as fines and incarceration, and/or confrontations with the victim's family.\nDriving between 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. should be done with extreme caution.  Automobiles, trucks, or “okadas” (motorbikes) often drive on the wrong side of the road or on sidewalks.\nTraffic Laws : Motor vehicle accidents can be reported by dialing “119.” Traffic control officers may occasionally seek bribes when citing drivers for traffic violations. If stopped by traffic police, drivers should stop as instructed. However, drivers should also keep their doors locked and only roll their windows down an inch for sound. Do not pay any bribes.If requested to drive an officer to the police station, do not do so, especially at night, as some traffic police are imposters.\nPublic Transportation :  We recommend avoiding public transportation throughout Nigeria. Public transportation vehicles, such as buses and motorbikes, are unsafe due to poor maintenance, high speeds, and overcrowding. Motorbikes are banned within Abuja's city limits and many major thoroughfares in Lagos. “Okada” drivers and passengers are required to wear helmets in several cities; police can fine violators on the spot.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information, and visit Nigeria’s  Federal Road Safety Corps  website.\nAviation Safety Oversight : The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Nigeria’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Nigeria’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel : Mariners planning travel to Nigeria or through the Gulf of Guinea should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  ICC  and  NGA  broadcast warnings.\nThe Commandant of the Coast Guard has determined that effective anti-terrorism measures are not in place in Nigeria ports and has imposed conditions of entry on vessels that arrive in U.S. ports having visited ports in Nigeria. Mariners and passengers on commercial vessels traveling through the ports of Nigeria should exercise increased caution."

For further updates, contact the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination, telephone: +92-51-910-7307, or email:  contact@dra.gov.pk.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Pakistan.\nFind information on  dual nationality,   prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Violent extremist groups within Pakistan continue to seek opportunities to attack locations where U.S. citizens and other Westerners are known to congregate or visit, including:\nTerrorists also target Pakistani officials, government facilities, security forces, and religious minorities.\nWe recommend you limit the frequency of travel and minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, and other public locations.\nAttacks have included armed assaults on heavily guarded sites, including Pakistani military and police installations, and airports. Primary tactics of terrorists include suicide operations, shootings, and bombings (including vehicle-borne explosives and improvised explosive devices), while other actions include but are not limited to assassinations, carjackings, kidnappings, and assaults. The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in major cities, and these measures can vary from day to day. However, the U.S. government is aware of narcotics smuggled onto flights from Pakistan, which may indicate broader security vulnerabilities at Pakistani airports.\nThe U.S. Embassy and Consulates regularly assess security situations and restrict the movements of official personnel as necessary.  Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to U.S. government personnel under Chief of Mission (COM) security responsibility. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates prohibit personnel under COM security responsibility from using public transportation or taxi services. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates also prohibit such personnel from visiting houses of worship.\nOfficial U.S. government personnel visiting Pakistan are authorized to stay overnight in certain local hotels in Islamabad, and some other areas of the country.  Avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Embassy and Consulates sometimes place areas such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls, and restaurants off-limits to official U.S. government personnel on official travel/orders.\nFollow media coverage of local events and maintain good situational awareness and operational security wherever you travel in Pakistan. If you feel that your life is in danger in Pakistan, we advise you to report the threat to local police authorities and consider immediately changing locations or departing Pakistan.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.  \nCrime:  All travelers are advised to dress conservatively, with arms and legs covered, and to avoid walking alone. We recommend avoiding travel on the streets late at night. Urban crime can be organized or opportunistic and conducted by individuals or groups. It can include fraud, theft, robbery, carjacking, assault, and burglary. Incidents of crime and levels of violence are higher in low-income residential and congested commercial areas but are seen in wealthier areas as well. Pickpocketing, theft, and larceny are common on buses and trains at all hours of the day.\nTake precautions to avoid crime, including:\nIf you are assaulted, flee to a safe area and report the situation to local authorities by going directly to a police station or dialing  15 .\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to local, national, or international current events, including on politically significant holidays.  \nDemonstrations, political rallies, or large religious gatherings intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. We advise U.S. citizens to avoid areas where large crowds of any kind gather. U.S Embassy and Consulate personnel are routinely instructed to avoid areas of any demonstration. During demonstrations or periods of civil unrest, the Pakistani government has in the past disabled cellular telephone and internet service, making it difficult for individuals to contact each other or the U.S. Embassy or Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General generally do not message or post information about routine demonstrations but will disseminate known information regarding demonstrations or unrest that pose a potentially specific threat to U.S. citizens, including U.S. government personnel in country.\nCelebratory gunfire may occur at any time but is most likely to occur during wedding celebrations, which are frequent from October to May, and on holidays such as New Year’s Eve. Although the likelihood of being struck is remote, falling rounds can cause injury or death.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI   pages for information. \nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. \nReport crimes to the local police at 15 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(92)(51) 201-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nPolice responsiveness varies widely, and crimes often go unsolved or unprosecuted.\nDual U.S-Pakistani nationals may not be recognized as U.S. citizens by local authorities and may be treated as Pakistani nationals by the police and the courts.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can: \nDomestic Violence:   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or the Consulates in Karachi or Lahore for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not regularly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.  First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage\nCriminal Penalties:   U.S. citizens are subject to the local laws of the foreign countries they visit or reside in. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. The U.S. government does not intervene with local authorities or advocate for particular outcomes on behalf of private individuals in legal matters.\nFurthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local laws. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad   and the  Department of Justice  website.\nIt is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings or structures, particularly sensitive places like military installations, cantonments, and nuclear sites, but the law on this subject is vague and applied inconsistently.\nIt is illegal to import alcohol into Pakistan without prior coordination with the government and even then, it is permissible only under very specific circumstances. Travelers entering Pakistan with alcohol face  potentially severe  penalties. Additionally, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs could result in imprisonment and other severe penalties.\nPenalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Pakistan are severe, and those convicted can expect lengthy imprisonment, heavy fines, and possible capital punishment.\nExit controls, or bans on departing the country, are frequently used as a condition of bail.\nCivil Matters : The Embassy often receives reports of property disputes and cannot become involved in civil matters.\nArrest Notification:   If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nPakistani law enforcement authorities will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is arrested or detained, unless you request they do so. Pakistan’s regulations governing the travel of foreign diplomats and the procedures for gaining access to arrested individuals have delayed consular access in the past. In some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to security-related travel restrictions.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, and they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up the counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website  and the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See the following webpages for details:\nInternational Volunteers:\nLGB Travelers:  Same-sex sexual conduct is a criminal offense in Pakistan. While the government rarely prosecutes cases, society generally shuns LGB persons, and violence and discrimination against LGB persons occur frequently.\nThe penalty for same-sex relations is a fine, imprisonment (sentences ranging from two years to life imprisonment), or both. No laws protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and LGB persons rarely reveal their sexual orientation. \nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for additional details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:   Even in major cities, accessibility for persons with physical disabilities is difficult.  Pakistani law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities,  but  the law is unevenly enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Do not expect public transportation, lodging, communication/information, or general infrastructure in Pakistan to have the same accessibility standards found in the United States. The availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for equipment and devices is limited, especially outside major population areas. Services for persons with disabilities may also be limited outside the largest cities.\nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .   \nWomen Travelers:  The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General often receive reports of U.S. citizens subjected to domestic violence, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and forced marriage in Pakistan. There are also cases of individuals having their own and their children’s passports confiscated by spouses, parents, or other family members and having their freedom of movement severely restricted. Local police are not consistently responsive to reports of such cases. Nonetheless, if you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you are encouraged to call the police immediately and follow up with a call to the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. We can sometimes connect you with a Pakistani non-governmental organization that may be able to provide assistance.\nIf you are victimized overseas, you may be entitled to receive compensation for counseling and/or other services such as relocation back to the United States. For further information, visit the  U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women .\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime committed in Pakistan\n See our travel tips for  Women Travelers . \nThe Government of Pakistan requires travelers age 12 and over be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pakistan reports Pakistan has endemic Wild Polio Virus. The government of Pakistan requires polio vaccination for some longer stays. Healthcare facilities and infrastructure is poor, especially outside major cities. Travelers are advised to have medevac insurance, to include repatriation of remains. Both medevacs and repatriations of remains for non-Pakistani citizens require Pakistani government permission.\nBasic medical care is available in major Pakistani cities but is limited in rural areas. Facilities in cities vary in quality and range of services and may be below U.S. standards; facilities in rural areas are consistently below U.S. standards. Medical facilities require pre-payment for services, and most do not accept credit cards.\nEffective emergency response to personal injury and illness is virtually non-existent in most of Pakistan. Ambulances are few, lack medical equipment, and are not necessarily staffed by medical personnel.\nIf you are hospitalized, a friend or family member will be expected to attend to your basic needs. There is generally no nursing staff or equivalent. For this reason, it is recommended never to travel alone to Pakistan. Outside major cities, English is not spoken by most medical providers and hospitals.\nPakistani hospital officials will typically not notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulates if a foreign citizen is hospitalized. Even if made aware of a medical situation, in some cases, a consular officer may not be able to visit due to travel restrictions.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of  doctors and hospitals . However, we do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health webpage and general Traveler Advice for  Pakistan .\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nThere is a risk of transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other communicable diseases, such as hepatitis and HIV, in Pakistan. Travelers are urged to use the same cautionary and protective health measures they would in their own country. For emergency services in Pakistan,  dial   15.\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.   Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance:   Travelers to Pakistan should obtain supplemental insurance to cover possible medical evacuation and repatriation of remains. If you plan to engage in high-risk outdoor activities in Pakistan, it is essential that you engage the services of a travel risk and crisis management provider.\nCare providers in Pakistan do not accept insurance.  With the exception of State and military hospitals, providers will require payment before treatment. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. \nVaccinations:   Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nPharmaceuticals:\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nAir pollution is a significant environmental problem across Pakistan. Throughout the country, air quality varies considerably by city and fluctuates greatly depending on the season and local weather patterns. We encourage you to consult with your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. It is typically at its worst during the winter in Pakistan. Anyone who travels to areas where pollution levels are high is at risk. People at the greatest risk from pollution exposure include:\nAir quality data for major cities in Pakistan can be found on the U.S. Embassy’s  website .\nWater Quality\nAdventure Travel:  Pakistan’s mountains and glaciers make it a tempting destination for adventure enthusiasts. Despite the best efforts of local authorities, assisting visitors lost or injured in such remote areas can be difficult. In recent years, several U.S. citizens, including expert climbers, have lost their lives while climbing in the Karakoram mountain range, where rescue missions are often difficult or impossible to execute. Costs for emergency rescues start at $15,000, and payment is required prior to commencement of a search operation.\nAltitude:  Some areas in Pakistan, especially K2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) in the Karakorum mountain range in the Gilgit-Baltistan region, are at high altitude. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Travel to High Altitudes . \nRoad Conditions and Safety:   While in Pakistan, you will encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Road infrastructure outside major cities is subject to weather and poor maintenance. The information below about Pakistan is provided for general reference only, and it might vary in a particular location or circumstance.\nTraffic Laws:  Traffic in Pakistan moves on the left; the opposite of U.S. traffic. Roads are crowded, drivers are often aggressive and poorly trained, and many vehicles, particularly large trucks and buses, are poorly maintained. Local drivers may drive head-on in your lane of traffic if they believe it helps them get to their destination more quickly. Animals, horse carts, bicyclists, and pedestrians can pose roadside hazards in some areas. Roads, including most major highways, also suffer from poor maintenance and often have numerous potholes, sharp drop-offs, and barriers that are not sign-posted. Drivers should exercise extreme caution when traveling at night by road, since many vehicles do not have working headlights or dimmers, and many roads are not illuminated or signed. We recommend driving with experienced local drivers or guides.\nPublic Transportation:  We recommend travelers remain cautious if using trains, taxis, and other forms of public transportation or online ride hailing services. For security reasons, U.S. government personnel are prohibited from using all forms of public transportation. See the  Safety and Security  section above.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.  Visit the website of  Pakistan’s national tourist office  and  Pakistan’s national highway authority .\nAviation Safety Oversight:    As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Pakistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page . \nMaritime Travel:   Mariners planning travel to Pakistan should check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts .  Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport  website, and the  NGA broadcast warnings  website."

This rule is strictly enforced by Panamanian immigration. Travelers must ensure that immigration officials place an entry stamp in their passport.  For further information contact the  Government of Panama Migration Service .\nTraveling with Minors - Minors (children under 18) who are Panamanian citizens (including dual citizens) or legal residents of Panama are required to present both parents’ identification documents, birth certificates, and notarized consent  (in Spanish)  in order to exit the country if not accompanied by both parents. The consent must also be apostilled if it was signed in the United States. A child born in Panama may automatically obtain Panamanian citizenship. Non-resident foreign minors are excluded from these provisions. \nHIV/AIDS Restrictions : Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Panama.  Panamanian immigration does not require an HIV/AIDS test. The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any U.S. citizens who have been deported due to HIV/AIDS.  Please verify this information with the  Embassy of Panama  before you travel.\nArriving by Sea : The Servicio Nacional de Migracion is currently enforcing an entry permit fee of $110 for sea travelers piloting their own boats and arriving as  tourists . This fee allows entry into Panama for a period of three months, and can be extended for up to two years through an approved application with the immigration authorities in Panama.  U.S. citizens navigating private craft through the Canal should contact the Panama Canal Authority at (011) 507-272-4570 or consult the  Panama Canal Authority web site  to make an appointment.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nThe Mosquito Gulf and the Darien Region are particularly dangerous due to their remoteness and the presence of criminal organizations.\nIn the Darien region, most travel is by river or by footpath due to the scarcity of roads. There are reports of narco-traffickers, and other smugglers and criminals operating in the Panama-Colombia border area.\nAccess to the “Mosquito Gulf” region is almost exclusively by boat and/or aircraft. Sections of this coastline are reportedly used for narco-trafficking and other illicit activities.\nDemonstrations:   There are often demonstrations to protest internal Panamanian issues or, more rarely, manifestations of anti-American sentiment. Some demonstrations may result in blocked roadways or major highways including in locations popular with U.S. citizens. Panamanian National Police will generally not use force against peaceful demonstrations or roadblocks. While most demonstrations are non-violent, the Panamanian National Police have used tear gas and/or riot control munitions in response to demonstrations, particularly when roadways are blocked or aggression is used against the police.\nBeach and Maritime Safety:   Many of Panama’s beaches on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts are subject to large waves and dangerous currents. Conditions can change rapidly and drowning deaths occur. Few beaches feature lifeguards.\nBoaters should be wary of vessels that may be transporting narcotics, other illicit materials, or might be involved in human smuggling operations. Packages containing narcotics have been found floating in the ocean or lying on remote beaches. Do not pick up or move these packages. Immediately report their location to the Panamanian authorities.\nLocal maritime search and rescue capabilities are limited. If you are experiencing an emergency at sea or know of someone who is experiencing an emergency off the coast of Panama, please contact the Panamanian authorities.\nCrime:   Panama City, Colon, and Chiriqui province have the highest crime rates. Crimes include shootings, home invasions, rapes, armed robberies, muggings, and thefts. You should take the same precautions you would take in other big cities.\nVictims of Crime:   Report crimes to the local police by dialing 104 (National Police) or 511-9260 (Tourist Police in Panama City) and contact the U.S. Embassy at +507-317-5000. \nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes that occur in Panama.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, first contact the local police at 104.\nTourism:   The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas and activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is often only available in or near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities, which limits their ability to provide urgent medical treatment in those areas. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on  insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. \nFurthermore, some offenses are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. See our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nIf you break local laws in Panama, your U.S. passport will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution, and the Embassy cannot get you out of jail or prison.  Keep in mind, if you are arrested for an offense, tried and convicted, you must be sentenced before you can be transferred to the United States to complete your sentence in the United States. This process can last three or more years.  \nCarry Identification:  Anyone not bearing identification may be held and will be penalized by the Panamanian authorities. You should always carry your passport that contains the Panama entry stamp in case it is requested by Panamanian authorities.\nDrugs:  Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Panama are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\nProperty:  Exercise extreme diligence in purchasing real estate in Panama. The U.S. Embassy in Panama has received numerous property dispute complaints. The complaints include lost property, broken contracts, and demands for additional payments, accusations of fraud and corruption, and occasionally threats of violence. More information can be found  here .\nCustoms Restrictions:  Panamanian customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning importation into or export from Panama of items such as firearms and ammunition, cultural property, endangered wildlife species, narcotics, biological material, and food products. Contact the  Panamanian Embassy  for specific information regarding customs requirements.\nDo not buy counterfeit and pirated goods, even if they are widely available as you may also be breaking local law. The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Division in the U.S. Department of Justice has more information on this serious problem. For further information about customs regulations, please read our  Customs Information page .\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the  Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report .\nLGB Travelers:  Same sex marriages are not conducted nor recognized in Panama. LGB individuals enjoy full legal rights in Panama. However, Panamanian law does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, and there is societal discrimination based on sexual orientation.  \nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance. Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what you find in the United States. Panamanian law only mandates access to new or remodeled public buildings for persons with disabilities, which is being enforced for new construction. Handicapped parking is often available at many larger parking lots.  \nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page.\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nPanama City is known to have some  good hospitals and clinics,  but medical facilities outside of the capital are limited. Hospitals in Panama are either private hospitals or government-run public hospitals. Private hospitals typically require payment of the anticipated costs of hospitalization prior to providing services and require payment of any additional costs upon release from the hospital. These costs can be in excess of USD$10,000-$20,000, depending on the nature of the treatment. In Panama, most hospitals accept credit cards for hospital charges, but not for doctors' fees and do not accept international wire transfers or credit card payments over the phone.\nExcept for antibiotics and narcotics, most medications are available without a prescription.\nThe 911-call center provides ambulance service in Panama City, Colon, and the Pan-American Highway between Panama City and Chiriqui. However, an ambulance may not always be available and given difficulties with traffic and poor road conditions, there may be a significant delay in response. There are private ambulance services available on a subscription basis.\nThe U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nCarry prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations : Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended  by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information :\nRoad Conditions and Safety :  While in Panama, you may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. Travelers should carry identification with them at all times and be prepared to stop for unannounced checkpoints throughout the country, especially at night. Traffic lights are infrequently located on roads throughout the country, even at busy intersections. Traffic in Panama moves on the right, as in the U.S. Panamanian law requires that drivers and passengers wear seat belts.\nDriving in Panama is often hazardous and difficult due to heavy traffic, undisciplined driving habits, poorly maintained streets and a shortage of effective signs and traffic signals. Use caution when driving at night; night driving is particularly hazardous on the old Panama City – Colon highway. Riding your bicycle on the streets is not recommended.  \nRoad travel is more dangerous during the rainy season (April to December) due to flooding. Rainy season occasionally makes city streets impassible and washes out some roads in the interior of the country. In addition, roads in rural areas are often poorly maintained and lack light at night.\nThere is often construction at night on Panama's portion of the Pan American highway. There are few signs alerting drivers to construction, and the highway is not well lit at night. When traveling on the highway, travelers should be aware of possible roadblocks. The Pan American Highway ends at Yaviza in the Darién Province of Panama and does not continue through to Colombia.\nTraffic Laws :   Current Panamanian law allows foreigners to drive in Panama using their valid foreign driver’s license for a period of only 90 days. Driving without a valid driver’s license is illegal in all areas of Panama. Drivers stopped for driving while intoxicated may face the loss of their driver’s license, a monetary penalty, and vehicle impoundment. Talking on a cell phone or drinking an alcoholic beverage while driving also carries a fine.\nIf you are involved in a vehicle accident, immediately notify the police. Third party liability auto insurance is mandatory, but many drivers are uninsured. If an accident occurs, the law requires that the vehicles be moved off the roadway. Failure to do so could result in a fine. If you are involved in an accident that did not cause injury, you should take a photo of both cars. If safe to do so, exchange information with the other driver and wait for the police to arrive.\nPublic Transportation : Public transportation should be used with caution. While we still receive reports of thefts and pick-pocketing, Panamanian National Police report the new metro buses with bigger windows and better lighting, have reduced the instances of violent crime.\nPlease refer to our  Road Safety page  for more information. Also, we suggest that you visit the websites of  Panama’s Tourism Authority ,  Transportation Authority , and  the national authority responsible for road safety in Panama  (Spanish-only) for helpful information on road conditions in Panama.\nAviation Safety Oversight :   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Panama’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Panama’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Panama should also check for U.S. maritime advisories and alerts at  www.marad.dot.gov/msci . Information may also be posted to the U.S. Coast Guard homeport website (https:homeport.uscg.mil), and the NGA broadcast warnings website  https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal ; select “broadcast warnings.”"

The  Embassy of Papua New Guinea  is located at 1825 K Street, NW, Suite 1010, Washington, DC 20006; telephone: 202-745-3680; email address visa@pngembassy.org. Visit the website of Papua New Guinea’s  Immigration and Citizenship Authority  for the most current visa information.\nIf you transit other countries en route to Papua New Guinea, follow all necessary exit/entry procedures for the countries you transit. You may need to obtain visas or travel authorizations for some of those countries. If you anticipate transiting or visiting Australia, obtain an  Electronic Travel Authority (ETA)  for Australia before leaving the United States.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:  The Government of Papua New Guinea imposes HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors and foreign residents. If you request residency or intend to remain long term in Papua New Guinea, you are required to have an HIV/AIDS test performed at a U.S. medical facility. Please verify this information with the  Embassy of Papua New Guinea  before you travel.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nSummary:\nCrime:   Papua New Guinea has a high crime rate.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes and law enforcement-related emergencies to local police by calling 112. In the event you are unable to get through to the police, operators with St. John Ambulance Service may be able to assist you by passing your request to the police control center. You may also contact the U.S. Embassy at +675 308 2100. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nOrganized Tours and Adventure Travel\nOrganized tours booked through travel agencies remain the safest means to visit Papua New Guinea, although on rare occasions, even persons participating in organized tours have been subject to violent crime and injury. If you choose to travel to Papua New Guinea with a group tour, here are some things to be aware of:\nDiving and Snorkeling:  Scuba divers and or snorkelers are advised to check the references, licenses, and equipment of tour operators before agreeing to a tour. Confirm the dive operator is certified through one of the international diving associations, and that their certification is current. Confirm with the diving association directly that the operator is certified. Local dive masters may not consider your skill level when they organize a trip.\nRent equipment only from trustworthy operators and be sure to receive training before using the equipment. Some rental diving equipment may not be properly maintained or inspected. Make sure that your travel medical insurance covers your sport. The  Divers Alert Network (DAN)  website has information on diver’s insurance.\nDeaths and serious accidents have occurred in the past because basic safety precautions were not taken during diving and snorkeling trips. Remember that safety measures and emergency responses may not meet U.S. standards.\nPapua New Guinea has one hyperbaric recompression chamber to provide medical assistance for dive-related injuries, located in Port Moresby at the Tropicair Hangar at Jacksons International Airport. However, it may not always be operational. Diving injuries may therefore require medical evacuation to Australia. Many popular dive sites are located near outlying islands, and it may take several hours to reach facilities in the event of an accident.\nOther Water Sports:  Exercise caution and common sense when engaging in all adventure sports, including but not limited to whitewater rafting, sea kayaking, and windsailing. Make sure your travel medical insurance covers your sport. Never participate in adventure sports alone. Before kayaking, rafting, or windsailing, check water conditions and wear a life jacket and helmet. Water conditions may become extremely dangerous during heavy rainfall, and flash floods are common.\nHiking:  Exercise caution if you plan to hike the Kokoda Track, the Black Cat Track, Mt. Wilhelm, Mt. Giluwe, or other established or informal hiking trails in Papua New Guinea. Hikers have been attacked and killed, even along the most well-known routes. Local landowners occasionally threaten to close parts of the tracks due to local land and compensation disputes. Carry a first aid kit and observe all local and trail-specific regulations.\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Adventure Travel .\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from relevant local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a conservative country and public displays of affection are generally not understood or welcomed. \nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance . Papua New Guinea does not have legislation mandating access to transportation, communication, and public buildings for persons with disabilities. The road network in Papua New Guinea is in poor condition. Foot paths, road crossings, and stairways in most major towns are congested, uneven, and are generally not constructed or maintained with an eye toward access for persons with disabilities.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Papua New Guinea prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, or mental disabilities, but is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure in both rural and urban areas, including the capital. The availability of rental, repair and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants is limited.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Sexual assault and gender-based violence are relatively common in Papua New Guinea. Though most often reported in urban centers and against the local population, these attacks can occur anywhere and also be directed against tourists or foreign residents. Police have limited capacity to respond to such crimes and health workers at local medical facilities may not be adequately trained or have the capacity to provide victim-centered care or administer post exposure prophylaxes. Women are advised of the following precautions:\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nSpecial Circumstances:\nCustoms:  Papua New Guinean customs authorities enforce strict regulations governing firearms, certain prescription drugs, wooden artifacts, animal products, food, and sexually explicit material. Firearms should not be brought into the country. Other products may be subject to quarantine. You should contact the  Embassy of Papua New Guinea  in Washington, D.C. for specific information regarding customs requirements.\nNatural Disasters:  Papua New Guinea is among the most disaster-prone countries in the world. Earthquakes, tropical cyclones, destructive tsunamis, exceptionally high tides, seasonal and flash flooding, and landslides can occur with little or no notice. The country has many active volcanoes. Recent eruptions have occurred in in Bougainville, East and West New Britain, and Manam Island. Ash from volcanoes in East and West New Britain occasionally disrupts air and ground operations at the airports in Kokopo and Hoskins.\nDocumentation:  Carry a copy of your U.S. passport and Papua New Guinean visa at all times so that you can demonstrate your proof of identity, U.S. citizenship, and immigration status to authorities if asked.\nFor emergency services in Papua New Guinea, dial 111 to reach St. John Ambulance Service.\nAmbulance services are:\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, as severe injuries often require medical evacuation to Australia, Singapore, the Philippines, or the United States at a cost of thousands of dollars. Medical evacuations to Australia require a visa or  Electronic Travel Authority .\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  Embassy of Papua New Guinea  to ensure the medication is legal in Papua New Guinea.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nPharmaceuticals:          \nWater Quality:\nGeneral Health:  The following diseases are prevalent:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Motor vehicle accidents are a common cause of serious injury in Papua New Guinea. Road travel outside of major towns can be hazardous due to car jackings, armed robbery, and criminal roadblocks near bridges, curves in the road, or other areas where vehicle speed and mobility is restricted. Be sure to:\nSafety risks include: \nTraffic Laws:  Traffic in Papua New Guinea moves on the left. Police roadblocks to check vehicle registrations are a regular occurrence at night in Port Moresby, and police may not always act in a professional manner. As a driver, you should ensure that your vehicle registration and safety stickers are up-to-date in order to minimize difficulties at police checkpoints.\nIf You Are Involved in a Road Accident:  Crowds can react emotionally and violently after road accidents.  Crowds form quickly after an accident and may attack those whom they hold responsible by stoning and/or burning vehicles. Friends and relatives of an injured party may demand immediate compensation from the party they hold responsible for injuries, regardless of legal responsibility. If you are involved in an accident and you feel threatened, go directly to the nearest police station instead of remaining at the scene of the accident.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid using local taxis or buses, known as Public Motor Vehicles (PMVs), as crimes such as robbery and sexual assault on buses are not uncommon. Use a reliable service provided by your hotel, employer, or colleagues.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nFor specific information concerning Papua New Guinea driving permits, vehicle inspection, road tax, road safety and mandatory insurance, please call the Papua New Guinea’s Motor Vehicles Insurance Limited at 675-325-9666 or 675-302-4600. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Papua New Guinea, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Papua New Guinea’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.  Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Papua New Guinea should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings .\nPersons arriving on or transiting through Papua New Guinea on sailboats or yachts should be aware that small-scale piracy can occur and has recently been reported near Madang and Milne Bay."

U.S. citizens with expired or damaged passports may not be allowed to enter and could be sent back to the United States at their own expense. Private U.S. citizens do not need a visa for stays of up to 90 days for tourism or business. Some minor children need a special notarized authorization from Paraguayan authorities to enter and exit the country when not accompanied by both legal parents/guardians. Please visit the Embassy’s  website  for more specifics about whether this applies to your situation.\nTo leave Paraguay by air, you must pay an airport departure tax. Some airlines include the Paraguayan airport departure tax in the cost of the airline ticket. It is recommended that you check with the airline in order to determine whether or not the departure tax has been included.\nVisit the  Embassy of Paraguay  website for the most current visa information.\nHIV/AIDS restrictions:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Paraguay.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nSecurity Messages:  Messages regarding demonstrations, strikes, and weather-related events are posted on the Embassy’s  website .\nTerrorism:  The U.S. Embassy is not aware of any specific threat to U.S. citizens in Paraguay. Nevertheless, you should remain vigilant at all times while travelling.\nCrime:  Transnational criminal organizations facilitate the illicit trafficking of arms, narcotics, and other goods in Paraguay, particularly along Paraguay’s eastern border with Brazil, most prominently from Pedro Juan Caballero south to Ciudad del Este, including the Tri-Border Area of Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Coupled with the lack of sufficient police enforcement, the involvement of these organizations heightens violent crime in these areas. The U.S. Embassy in Asuncion requires U.S. government personnel and their family members to provide advance notice and a travel itinerary when traveling outside of the capital, particularly when traveling to Ciudad del Este, or to the departments of Alto Parana, San Pedro, Concepcion, Amambay, and Canindeyu. \n\nU.S. citizens visiting or residing in Paraguay should also avoid large gatherings or events where crowds have congregated to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches.\nStreet crime is prevalent in the cities and the number of pickpockets and armed assaults is increasing. Robbers are more regularly using motorcycles to approach victims with a weapon and demand a wallet or purse, before quickly fleeing.\nThieves have been known to pose as service people (e.g., mailmen, reporters, water meter readers, electrical repairmen, delivery persons, maintenance personnel) to gain access to homes. They sometimes wear uniforms and travel in vans and automobiles with markings that make the vehicle appear official. Do not let such people inside your home unless you have contacted the service provider directly to verify the appointment.\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Paraguay are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Additionally, it is not uncommon for individuals detained on drug-related charges to spend extended periods in detention before trial. \n \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. \n \n Arrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information. \n \n Faith-Based Travelers:  See the  Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report .\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Paraguay. See our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details. \n \nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance: Paraguayan law prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, and the provision of state services, and the government seeks to enforce these prohibitions. Nonetheless, access to buildings, pedestrian paths, and transportation is extremely difficult for persons with disabilities, as mandated accessibility requirements are rarely enforced.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas.

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor-issued written prescription. \nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  U.S. citizens have been injured and killed in traffic accidents throughout Paraguay. Only minimal standards must be met to obtain a Paraguayan driver’s license, and a driver’s education prior to licensing is not common. \n  \nTraffic Laws:  Drivers throughout Paraguay routinely ignore traffic regulations. No vehicle insurance is required, and many Paraguayans drive without insurance coverage. \n  \n  Public Transportation:  Public transportation is readily available for urban and intercity travel. Buses vary in maintenance conditions and may not meet U.S. safety standards. Taxis are available and may be called using telephone numbers listed in newspapers. Mobile ride hailing services are also available in the capital area. No passenger train service exists. Bicycle travel may not be safe because of traffic and other road hazards. \n  \n Most urban streets consist of cobblestones over dirt. Nearly all rural roads are unpaved and may be impassable during rainy periods and the rainy season (November-April). Driving or traveling at night is not advisable outside of Asuncion, due to the presence of pedestrians, animals, or vehicles without proper lighting on the roads. \n  \n See our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of Paraguay’s  national tourist office  and  national authority  responsible for road safety. The Touring and Automobile Club provides some roadside assistance to its  members . The club may be contacted in Asuncion by visiting its offices at 25 de Mayo near Avenida Brazil or by calling 210-550 to 210-553. Intercity highway maintenance is not equal to U.S. standards. The privately maintained toll road between Caaguazu and Ciudad del Este and the routes between Asuncion and Encarnacion and Asuncion and Pedro Juan Caballero are generally in good condition. The Trans-Chaco route is in fair condition except for the portion between Mariscal Estigarribia and the Bolivian border, which is unpaved and at times impassable. \n  \n  Aviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Paraguay, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Paraguay’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Peruvian immigration procedures are complex for minors traveling without one or both parents/legal guardians.\nFor entry/exit from Peru, U.S. citizen minors under the age of 18, traveling alone (or with only one parent), generally do not require additional documentation if entering as a tourist for less than 183 days. However, if the stay lasts more than 183 days, then a Permiso Notarial de Viaje is required (see below).\nU.S. citizen minors who are dual national Peruvians, traveling alone (or with only one parent), require a Permiso Notarial de Viaje. Furthermore, step-parents or guardians accompanying a dual U.S.-Peruvian citizen minor must provide a Permiso Notarial de Viaje from the non-traveling minor’s parents (as listed on the birth certificate). Finally, if an accompanying parent has sole custody, legal documentation is required (such as a foreign court-approved custody document stating sole custody, a death certificate, a Peruvian court-approved document for travel, or a birth certificate listing only one parent).\nA Permiso Notarial de Viaje is a written, notarized authorization from the non-traveling parent(s). Peruvian immigration will not accept a document notarized by the U.S. Embassy or a document notarized by a U.S. notary in lieu of a Permiso Notarial de Viaje.

Illicit activities, such as illegal mining, logging, and coca production, are common.\nDrug trafficking and other criminal activity, combined with poor infrastructure, limit the capability and effectiveness of Peruvian law enforcement in these areas.\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens along the Colombian border and in the VRAEM, as U.S. government personnel are restricted from traveling in these regions.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:   See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nFinancial scams are prevalent in Peru.

Do not expect vehicles to stop.\nTraffic Laws:  If you are involved in an accident, contact the local police, and attempt to stay inside your car until the police arrive before engaging with the other driver.

U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant with regard to their personal security.\nCrime:  Crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, particularly at popular tourist sites, restaurants, and on public transportation, are common. Pickpockets take advantage of crowds getting on and off all forms of public transportation, such as the popular Tram 28, using the jostling of the crowd as a distraction. Avoid standing near the doors on public transportation, as thieves will often strike just as the train/bus doors open and then dash onto the platform and disappear into the crowd.\nDemonstrations  occur in Portugal.

Fines for traffic offenses are substantial.\nPublic Transportation:  Taxis and prominent ride-sharing services such as Uber are a reliable means of transportation. Refer to the crime section of this page to alert yourself to other threats related to taxis and ride-sharing services. Bus service is also reliable.\nIn the Azores, driving can be challenging due to narrow cobblestone streets, blind curves, blind corners, and livestock on country roads. Public buses are inexpensive.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nExit bans  prevent those faced with legal proceedings from leaving Qatar until their case is abandoned or resolved.  This can take months or years. The Government of Qatar does not offer any social support for individuals under exit bans.\nReasons for exit bans can include:\nU.S. citizens have been subjected to exit bans and/or placed in prison pending payment of debts.\nAlways carry a copy of your passport for proof of identity, or authorities may detain you for questioning.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, deported, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nCriminal penalties for certain offenses are much harsher than those in the U.S.:\nArrest Notification:  Qatari authorities do not routinely notify the U.S. Embassy of a U.S. citizen’s arrest.

Once arrested, only the Qatari Public Prosecution and Courts have the authority to grant a release.\nSee our  webpage  for further information.\nQatari law favors employers over employees.  In the event of a contract or employment dispute, Qatari authorities refer to the Arabic language of a contract. Employees have limited recourse if their employer terminates a contract early. If a sponsor files a complaint against an employee who departed Qatar, the employee may be barred from returning to Qatar, even on a tourist or airport visa. Many terminated U.S. citizens have been barred from departing Qatar because of pre-existing debt.\nDespite recent legal changes, transferring employment prior to the end of a contract often requires the permission of the previous employer and is subject to approval by the Ministry of the Interior. Additional mechanisms for transferring employers exist through the Ministry of Interior in cases such as bankruptcy, abuse, or repeated failure to pay an employee on time.\nDrug Use:  Most drugs that are illegal in the United States are also illegal in Qatar, including marijuana/THC, CBD products, and vape products. The potential consequences for use or possession may be harsh.  \nClothing : Many public areas in Qatar have dress codes that require both men and women cover shoulders, chests, stomachs, and knees, and that tight leggings be covered by a long shirt or dress. Attire standards can vary between neighborhoods and facilities.  \n  \n Faith-Based Travelers:  Religion is a very sensitive issue in Qatar; treat any discussions on religion with care and caution. The law provides for a prison sentence of up to seven years for defaming, desecrating, or committing blasphemy against Islam, Christianity, or Judaism.

If you are caught operating a vehicle without a valid license, penalties can be severe.  For more information, see the  Qatari Traffic Services website .\nTraffic accidents  are one of the leading causes of death in Qatar. The extensive use of roundabouts, numerous road construction projects, and high-speed driving can be challenging. In rural areas, poor lighting, wandering camels, and roads without shoulders create hazards.  If you are in an accident without a license, any insurance may be held invalid, and you could be left with extensive bills and legal charges.\nAvoid arguments over traffic incidents . Qatari citizens who feel insulted can file a police complaint that can result in your arrest and overnight detention. Drivers are liable for persons injured in a traffic accident. Local police have held U.S. citizens overnight while ascertaining the extent of injuries.\nTraffic Fines:  Please be aware that traffic offenses are easily captured via well-placed cameras and the fines can be expensive. Unpaid traffic fines can result in an exit ban until reconciled. \nPublic Transportation:  Regulated and registered taxi services (Uber, Karwa, Fox Transportation, and Careem) are widely available and generally safe to use.

Malawian police operate radar-based speed traps throughout the country and you are expected to pay fines on the spot—please ensure you get a receipt. You must obtain a locally issued driver's license if you remain in Malawi for an extended period and plan to drive. Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. You should always wear a seat belt whenever available and insist drivers maintain a safe speed.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Malawi, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Malawi’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

If you enter the country on a Saudi laissez-passer (temporary travel document), you may encounter difficulty leaving the Kingdom.\nSaudi embassies do not have the authority to adjudicate citizenship claims or issue passports, but they may issue a laissez-passer for presumed Saudi citizens for whom citizenship has not been adjudicated, such as children of a Saudi parent or parents who were married outside of Saudi Arabia. Once admitted to Saudi Arabia on a laissez-passer, the traveler must obtain a Saudi passport before leaving the country. Saudi nationality is not conferred quickly or easily, and the processing time for a Saudi passport in these cases has often been six months or years in some cases. Obtaining a U.S. passport will not help, as you will not be able to leave Saudi Arabia without an exit visa which will not be granted if you entered as a Saudi citizen.\nThe Department strongly recommends that U.S. citizens enter Saudi Arabia on a U.S. passport and Saudi visa, and not a laissez-passer.\nLength of Stay:  Bearers of tourist visas are generally admitted for a 90-day stay and may not remain in the Kingdom more than 180 days in a twelve month period. Carefully check your visa validity and length of stay granted, and clarify any questions on permitted length of stay with Saudi immigration officials on arrival. Dates are calculated in accordance with the Hijri calendar, which differs from the Gregorian calendar.\nIf you overstay your visa, you could face significant fines, detention, and/or deportation, and a ban from returning to Saudi Arabia.\nThe U.S. Embassy is unable to intercede, reduce fines, or prevent incarceration if you violate Saudi law.\nTravel Bans:  When placed under a travel ban, you cannot exit the country, even if you are a U.S. citizen or a dual U.S.-Saudi citizen. Travel bans are rigidly enforced and can take months or even years to resolve. Only Saudi Arabian authorities and sponsors can remove travel bans.\nThe government may issue travel bans on people who are/have:\nThe list above is not exhaustive. Private Saudi citizens may also initiate travel bans against foreign citizens for various reasons.\nResidency Permits:  If you are seeking residency in Saudi Arabia, make sure you have all required legal documents authenticated before arriving. Neither the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh nor the U.S. Consulates General in Jeddah or Dhahran can provide this service.\nYou should have all U.S. issued documents authenticated by the  Department of State Office of Authentications  (202-485-8000) and attested by the  Embassy of Saudi Arabia  in Washington D.C.\nWork Visas: If you plan on working in Saudi Arabia, you must obtain a work visa before you arrive. Foreigners working in Saudi Arabia are subject to the country’s sponsorship system, which concedes substantial legal authority over the worker to the employer. This can include the ability to prevent the employee from leaving the country. American citizens considering working in Saudi Arabia should carefully review the information about employment in the “Local Laws and Special Circumstances” section below.\nIf the visitor or business visa has been annotated “not permitted to work,” you are not allowed to legally work in Saudi Arabia. You risk substantial financial penalties, detention, deportation, and a ban from returning to Saudi Arabia if you work without legal permission. Additionally, without a work visa, there would be no legal grounds to pursue a case against an employer should a dispute arise.\nHIV/AIDS:  To obtain work and residence permits, you are required to obtain a medical report or physical examination confirming that you are free from contagious diseases, including HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. If you test positive for HIV/AIDS or hepatitis, you will not be allowed to work in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia has not imposed HIV/AIDS or hepatitis travel restrictions on other categories of travelers. Please inquire directly with the  Embassy of Saudi Arabia  before you travel.\nVaccinations:  Visitors to Saudi Arabia should check vaccination requirements on the  Saudi Ministry of Health website.\nYemen Travel:  The Department strongly advises U.S. citizens against travel to Yemen due to the ongoing conflict in that country. See our  Yemen Travel Advisory  for further information. A visa is required to enter Saudi Arabia, and Saudi authorities generally do not permit foreign citizens to enter Saudi Arabia using land border crossings from Yemen. The Embassy and Consulates General cannot provide assistance to U.S. citizens seeking to cross the Yemeni-Saudi border.\nThe Department of State advises you to exercise increased caution when traveling to Saudi Arabia due to terrorism and the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets. See the Travel Advisory for Saudi Arabia  here .\nDo not travel:\nTerrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi Arabia. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Terrorists have targeted both Saudi and Western government interests, mosques and other religious sites (both Sunni and Shia), and places frequented by U.S. citizens and other Westerners.\nHouthis operating in Yemen have fired long-range missiles into Saudi Arabia, specifically targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure; they have publicly stated their intent to continue doing so. Missile attacks have targeted major cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah, Riyadh’s international airport, Saudi Aramco facilities, and vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. Rebel groups are also in possession of unmanned aerial systems (UASs or drones) which they have used to target civilian infrastructure and military facilities in Saudi Arabia. U.S. citizens living and working on or near such installations, particularly in areas near the border with Yemen, are at heightened risk of missile and drone attack.\nOn October 11, 2018 the Saudi General Authority for Civil Aviation issued a Notice to Airmen about threats to civil aviation and airports in Saudi Arabia posed by missiles and UASs launched from Yemen. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the U.S. Government’s Defense Internet NOTAM Service (Type “OEJD” in the search field, then click “View NOTAMs,” then scroll down to W0438/18 and click to view).\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the following locations as U.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from travel to:\nYou can find additional details relating to safety and security in our  Travel Advisory  and Alerts and the website of the  U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia .\nCrime:  Crime in Saudi Arabia has increased over recent years but remains at levels far below most major metropolitan areas in the United States.\nSee the websites of the  Department of State  and the  FBI  for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime, you should contact the local police at “999” and contact the Embassy in Riyadh or one of the Consulates in Jeddah or Dhahran.Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee the Department of State’s webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nThe Department can:\nDomestic Violence:  If you are the victim of any form of physical violence, including domestic violence, you should contact the Saudi police by calling “999”.  In addition, victims of domestic violence can contact the Saudi National Domestic Violence Hotline by dialing “1919.” The Saudi Ministry of Labor and Social Development runs a network of shelters for women and children. Contacting the domestic violence hotline (“1919”) is the only way to access these shelters. The Saudi National Family Safety Program also runs a Child Help Line “116111” and can assist children in accessing Saudi social services.\nWhen reporting domestic violence, it is imperative to get a case reference number as all Saudi social and legal assistance is tied to this case number. It is also a good idea to document any injuries and obtain a copy of any medical reports. U.S. citizens should be advised that filing a police report or utilizing any Saudi victims’ assistance services may result in the Saudi authorities informing your sponsor or guardian.\nU.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulates for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on  insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nDual Citizenship:  Saudi Arabia generally does not recognize dual nationality. Saudi law requires Saudi citizens to obtain official permission from the government before obtaining a second nationality. At times, Saudi authorities have confiscated the passports of U.S. citizens applying for Saudi citizenship. This does not constitute loss of U.S. citizenship. If this happens to you or someone you know, report the incident to the U.S. Embassy.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or consulate immediately. Be aware that Saudi Arabia generally restricts consular notification of the arrest of foreigners to the Embassy of the country that issued the travel document used to enter the Kingdom. If you enter Saudi Arabia with a Saudi travel document, or with the passport of a country other than the United States, it will be extremely difficult for the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services if you are subsequently detained. Persons detained in Saudi Arabia may be held without charges for lengthy periods and denied access to counsel; dual citizens may not have consular assistance. See the  Embassy’s webpage  for further information.\nDrones:  The importation of drones for commercial or personal use is prohibited without prior approval from the General Authority for Civil Aviation (GACA). A customs clearance certificate authorizing importation can be obtained as part of the GACA approval process. Visit  GACA’s website  for further information.\nCriminal Penalties:  While in Saudi Arabia, you are subject to local laws. If you violate Saudi laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled; arrested; imprisoned; held without trial for lengthy periods of time; interrogated without counsel; subject to corporal punishments, including lashings; or executed.\nPenalties for the import, manufacture, possession, and consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs in Saudi Arabia are severe. Convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences, heavy fines, public floggings, and deportation. The penalty for drug trafficking is death. Furthermore, some laws are prosecutable in the United States regardless of local law. For examples, see our webpage on crimes against minors abroad and the  Department of Justice website .\nThere are substantial limitations on freedom of speech and political expression in Saudi Arabia. For additional information see the Department of State’s  Human Rights Report for Saudi Arabia .\nFaith-Related Travel Issues:  Islam is the official religion of the country and is present in all aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. See our  Hajj and Umrah Fact Sheet .\nLGB Travelers:  Same-sex sexual relations, even when consensual, are criminalized in Saudi Arabia. Violations of Saudi laws governing perceived expressions of, or support for, same-sex sexual relations, including on social media, may be subject to severe punishment. Potential penalties include fines, jail time, or death. See our  LGB Travel Information page  and section 6 of the  Department of State's Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodation very different from what is generally found in the United States. Saudi law does not prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities, and there is no legislation requiring public accessibility. Newer commercial and government buildings, however, often include such access. According to the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, there are numerous government-sponsored centers for people with disabilities. Note that Saudi Arabia has limited infrastructure to care for those with mental disabilities.\nStudents:  See the Department’s  Students Abroad page  and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Residents and Travelers:  Married women, including non-Saudis, require their husband's permission to depart the country, while unmarried women and children require the permission of their father or male guardian.\nMinor children must have their father’s permission in order to leave the Kingdom. Children visiting their fathers in Saudi Arabia, even when there is a custody agreement, can be prevented from leaving unless the father consents. This is true even if the child is an American citizen. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates cannot obtain exit visas for the departure of minor children without their father/guardian's permission.\nIf a foreigner and a Saudi living in Saudi Arabia divorce, Saudi courts rarely grant permission for the foreign parent to leave the country with the children born during the marriage, even if he or she has been granted physical custody.\nForeign mothers of Saudi children, who are divorced or widowed, may apply for a permanent residency permit(iqama) without the need for a sponsor. To do so, they must prove maternity and that they were legally married to the Saudi father.\nAlso see the Department’s travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nEmployment:  The Arabic text of a contract governs employment and business arrangements under Saudi law. Verbal assurances or side letters are not binding under Saudi law. In the event of any contract dispute, Saudi authorities refer to the written contract.\nCustoms:\nImporting Animals:  The Saudi Ministry of Agriculture must approve all pets imported into Saudi Arabia.\nTeaching English in Saudi Arabia:  In recent years, increasing numbers of American language teachers have experienced contractual and other problems. Some teachers have complained about arbitrary dismissals, difficult living conditions, salary arrears, unwanted reassignments, restrictions on their movement, and inability to leave the country. Prospective teachers in Saudi Arabia should vet their potential employer and carefully review their employment offer as well as the detailed information found in the Embassy’s  Guide to Teaching English in Saudi Arabia . Additionally, prospective teachers should also take care to make sure that they obtain the appropriate work visa prior to coming to Saudi Arabia. The Embassy cannot help you if you violate Saudi labor law.\nStandards of Conduct and Religious Police:  Norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are extremely conservative. Both the uniformed police and the religious police, referred to colloquially as the mutawwa or al-hay’a, are charged with enforcing these standards.\nIn most areas of Saudi Arabia, and particularly in Riyadh and the central part of the Kingdom, women wear a full-length covering known as an abaya. Most women in conservative areas also cover their hair with a hijab for modesty, and many also cover their faces with a niqab.\nTourists are expected to dress modestly in public, avoiding tight fitting clothing or clothes with profane language or images; women are not required to wear abayas or cover their hair but are expected to cover their shoulders and knees, and men should not go without a shirt. Women who choose not to conform to Saudi Arabia’s dress code face a risk of confrontation by mutawwa, negative or hostile comments by Saudi citizens, and possible detention Guidelines on public decorum for tourists are available at the Saudi government’s official tourism website, www.visitsaudi.com. Many areas of life in Saudi Arabia are segregated by sex to ensure that unrelated men and women have no possibility of mingling (a punishable crime) by unmarried men and women. Less frequently, members of the mutawwa try to enforce this by asking for proof that a couple is married or related. Men and women detained for socializing with individuals who are not relatives may be charged with moral crimes such as khulwa (mixing with unrelated members of the opposite sex). Less frequently, some restaurants may refuse to serve women who are not accompanied by a close male relative In addition, a few restaurants or cafes do not have a \"family section\" in which women are permitted to eat. Men not accompanied by a close female family member are not allowed to enter family sections and cannot use services (such as registers at supermarkets) designated as “family.” These restrictions are not always clearly posted.\nWhile there are now movie theaters, musical concerts, and artistic performances in Saudi Arabia, the country remains socially conservative. Social media postings which contravene cultural standards can have legal and/or criminal consequences.\nPhotography:  The Saudi government does not permit photography of governmental facilities, such as military bases and government buildings, nor military, security, or police personnel. The Saudi government is also sensitive to photographs that may be perceived as portraying the country in an unfavorable light. This policy can include photos of mosques, impoverished areas, the local population, and traditional souks (markets). You should not take anyone’s picture without clear consent, and never take a picture of a woman or a place where women congregate. Be aware of local sensitivities whenever you are taking pictures in public. U.S. citizens have been routinely detained for violating these policies. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are unable to intervene if you violate Saudi law.\nThe Hajj and Umrah:  Please review the Department of State’s  Hajj and Umrah Fact Sheet  for useful information on traveling to perform the Hajj or Umrah.\nCOVID-19 Testing:  COVID-19 testing is available to U.S. citizens throughout Saudi Arabia at public and private facilities. Private hospitals and clinics charge a fee for COVID-19 testing.  Cost, delivery method, and timing of results varies. Some facilities can electronically deliver results within 24 hours or less.  \nCOVID-19 Vaccines:  The COVID-19 vaccine is available for U.S. citizens to receive in Saudi Arabia. For more information, please see the  Ministry of Health’s website.\nVisit the FDA's website to learn more about  FDA-approved vaccines  in the United States.\nMedical care varies greatly in quality, and high-profile cases of medical malpractice and errors have occurred. Consult your regular physician if you are considering serious medical treatment in Saudi Arabia.\nThe U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulates General do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance: Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers in Saudi Arabia accept cash or credit card payments.  See the Department’s webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation is strongly recommended. If you are covered by Saudi insurance, be sure to read the fine print: local insurance can have exclusions that are unusual in the United States. For example, some local policies may not supply coverage for accidents that occur while engaging in adventure sports, such as riding quad vehicles in the desert, that are a common past-time for expatriates.\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the  government of Saudi Arabia  to ensure the medication is legal in Saudi Arabia. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. \nPlease note:\nBe up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFor further health information, go to:\nHEALTH\nMedical care varies greatly in quality, and high profile cases of medical malpractice and errors have occurred.

With a valid visitor visa and U.S. or international driver’s license, visitors may drive a rental car. However, outside the major cities of Riyadh, Dhahran and Jeddah, visitors—especially women—may experience difficulty renting a car. Female residents with independent sponsorships and U.S. or international driver’s licenses also may obtain a Saudi driver’s license, necessary to drive vehicles other than rental cars. Foreign women residing in Saudi Arabia who are listed as dependents on their Saudi residency permit (“iqama”) may experience difficulties in obtaining Saudi driver’s licenses. To drive vehicles other than rental cars, a Saudi driver’s license, appropriate car registration, and auto insurance are required. Police may detain you if you cannot produce these documents.\nSee the  Saudi Arabian Ministry of Interior  website for further information.\nTraffic Laws :\nPublic Transportation:\nPlease refer to the Department’s  Road Safety page  for more information. Also, it is recommended that you visit the website of the  Saudi Arabian Ministry of Interior .\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Saudi Arabia's Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards for oversight of Saudi Arabia's air carrier operations.

Landmines from prior conflicts remain a concern, particularly in more remote parts off main roads. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Casamance region.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. While Senegal has not experienced any recent terrorist attacks, many places throughout West Africa, including Kayes Region of Mali on Senegal’s border, have witnessed such violence. More generally, terrorists increasingly have utilized less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, they seek out unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: \nCrime:  Street crime, including robberies at knife-point and home burglaries, is common in Senegal, particularly in urban areas. Beware of pickpockets, purse-snatchers, and thieves on motorized scooters. Robberies occur regularly along the Corniche d’Ouest, an area heavily frequented by tourists and westerners. \nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  \nInternational Financial Scams:   See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Senegal. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Common scams include:\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault should contact the local police and the U.S. Embassy.       \nReport crimes to the local police at 17 or to the Gendarmerie at 800-00-20-20 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(221) 33-879-4000. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy for assistance.\nSwimming:  An increasing number of children drown each year in the Atlantic Ocean in Senegal. Riptides can occur anywhere on the coast.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access and provide urgent medical treatment areas outside of major cities. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nSpecial Circumstances:  Senegal is generally a very tolerant society with excellent relations between the approximately 95 percent of the Senegalese population who practice Islam and the remaining five percent that practice Christianity and other religions. Senegalese culture is conservative, however, particularly in rural regions. Be mindful of local social and cultural mores pertaining to dress, displays of affection, and interactions between men and women.\nPersonal Identification:  Senegalese law requires all persons to carry valid personal identification at all times, and authorities may detain anyone, including U.S. citizens, who do not cooperate and provide identification. However, to minimize inconvenience in the event of theft, it is recommended that U.S. citizens carry copies, rather than originals, of their passports and other identification documents.\nCurrency:  Senegal’s currency is the franc of the Communauté Financière d'Afrique (fCFA), which has an exchange rate fixed to the Euro. Senegal’s economy operates primarily on a cash basis. Credit cards are not widely accepted. Although ATMs are available in some areas (primarily Dakar), they are not always reliable and should generally be avoided. Mobile money services, using local cell phone accounts, are becoming more common. You may be able to transfer money from the United States using a commercial wire-transfer company.\nLGB Travelers:  Same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Senegal. LGB individuals routinely face discrimination. Under Article 319 of the Senegalese criminal code, “unnatural acts” are punishable by imprisonment of one to five years and a fine of fCFA 1,000,000 (USD $2,000). Several high-profile cases of arrest under these laws have occurred.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our   Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Senegal prohibits discrimination against persons with physical or mental disabilities but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\nThe availability of rental, repair or replacement parts for aids, equipment, and devices for people with disabilities, including service providers such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited, especially outside of the capital city.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Rape is a crime in Senegal punishable by up to 10 years in prison, though it is rarely prosecuted. Spousal rape is not criminalized. Domestic violence that causes lasting injury is punishable by up to twenty years in prison. Domestic violence that results in death is punishable by life in prison. However, the law against domestic violence is rarely enforced.\nFemale genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is not specifically outlawed in Senegal and is commonly practiced in the south and southeast of the country.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nSeveral hospitals and clinics in Dakar can treat major and minor injuries and illnesses; however, medical facilities outside Dakar are extremely limited and unprepared to handle major injuries. There is inadequate inpatient psychiatric care and limited office-based psychiatric treatment in Dakar.\nFor emergency services in Senegal, dial 800-881-881 (Toll Free/Numero Vert) for SAMU.  \nAmbulance services are either unavailable or unreliable in most areas except Dakar, where ambulance services exist but can often arrive with great delay (up to 30-45 minutes). In the event an ambulance is not immediately available (the services will often provide an estimated time of arrival), injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a list of doctors and hospitals  here  under \"local resources.\" We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nWe do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas.\nMedical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry prescription medication in its original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nThe following diseases are present:\nVaccinations : Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations recommended  by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information :\nWater Quality:  In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water. Wash raw vegetables and fruits in a bleach solution before eating.\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Driving is generally riskier and more challenging than in the United States. Drivers tend to exceed speed limits, follow other vehicles closely, ignore lane markings, and attempt to pass even when facing oncoming traffic. Roadways are poorly lit and poorly marked, and many sections have deteriorated surfaces. Due to limited street lighting, pedestrians are difficult to see at night. Drivers in both rural and urban areas may frequently expect to encounter and share the road with motorcycles, bicyclists, pedestrians, livestock, and animal carts. For information about automobile accidents in Senegal, visit the  U.S. Embassy Dakar  website.\nWhile most main roads in Senegal are in relatively good condition for daytime driving, secondary roads are poor by U.S. standards. During the rainy season, many roads are passable only with four-wheel drive vehicles.\nTraffic Laws:  Traffic circulates on the right in Senegal. All drivers are expected to carry the following documents in their vehicles: (1) valid driver's license; (2) valid insurance papers; (3) vehicle registration/matriculation card (\"carte grise\"); (4) \"vignette\" tax disc for the current year; and (5) valid identification. Copies of U.S. passports must be clear enough to identify the driver of the vehicle.\nPublic Transportation:  U.S. citizens should avoid using motorbikes, van taxis (\"cars rapides\"), and public transportation. Regulated orange-striped sedan auto taxis are safer, but make sure to agree on a fare before beginning the trip.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  There is direct commercial air service between the United States and Senegal. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is in the process of assessing the government of Senegal’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards, and the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is assessing the implementation of ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) for aviation security. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Senegal should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website  and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

Frequently, they target unprotected or vulnerable venues, such as:\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nAnti-U.S. Sentiments:  While Serbians can be welcoming to visitors, anti-U.S. sentiment is widespread and can be more prevalent around certain anniversaries and some national holidays, including: February 17 (anniversary of Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence), between March 24 and June 10 (the anniversary of the 1999 NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia in response to events in Kosovo), and potentially June 28 (St. Vitus’s Day or Vidovdan).\nSporting Events:  There is the potential for violence before, during, and after sporting events. There have been clashes between police and fans in the vicinity of sports venues, which are often located in residential areas.  The Embassy considers matches between certain teams, including Partizan, Rad, and Red Star, to be high risk events because of violence at previous games.  While U.S. citizens have not been targeted in the past, in a few isolated cases non-Serbians have been the victims of sports-related violence. U.S. Government employees are generally advised to avoid the vicinity of high-profile sporting events.\nNight Clubs:  As a safety precaution due to xenophobic violence, the following clubs have been declared off-limits for U.S. Embassy personnel in Serbia:\nCrime: \nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  If you or someone you know becomes the victim of a crime in Serbia, you should contact the local police. Report crimes first to the local police by dialing 192.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the Serbian government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

Serbia has active and increasingly-visible LGB advocacy groups, and several LGB bars operate openly and without problems in Belgrade. Many recent LGB public eventshave been held without incident. However, LGB travelers should exercise caution when visiting Serbia. Many LGB persons in Serbia choose not to openly reveal their sexual orientation or show public displays of affection due to security and safety concerns, and many avoid reporting incidents to police. Similarly, many LGB persons often find themselves targets of discrimination and violence and therefore may make the choice to hide or modify their identities when in public spaces. Though a growing number of police officers have received training on how to work with LGB individuals, including when they are victims of crime, many have limited experience and knowledge.  \nFor further general information on travel abroad by LGB individuals, please read our  LGB Travel Information  page.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Serbia prohibits discrimination against persons with  physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication. Expect accessibility to be limited in lodging, and general infrastructure, and common in public transportation.While there is some accessibility for travelers with disabilities in Belgrade and Novi Sad, there are limited to no accessibility in the rest of Serbia.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  women travelers .\nBringing Money into Serbia:  If you enter Serbia with more than 10,000 euro in cash (or equivalent in other currencies), you must declare it to customs.

Buses are often crowded, and some lines and vehicles are poorly maintained.

Many beaches have varying strong/rip currents.  Most beaches do not have a regular lifeguard presence.\nCrime:  Muggings and petty crime such as purse snatching and pickpocketing are reportedly on the increase and can be a problem especially in and around tourist facilities and ATMs. Theft from vehicles and on beaches or walking trails occurs in areas frequented by foreigners.\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Consular Agency and/or the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry has regulations for certain activities, although safety inspections for equipment and facilities may not always be carried out regularly.  Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified in support of organized activities either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only on the main islands of Mahé, Praslin, and La Digue. First responders are generally unable to access more remote islands to provide urgent medical treatment, and emergency facilities and/or medical personnel on individual islands vary, or may not exist at all. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance  and verify that operators are licensed prior to engaging their services for special activities. \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws.

In some instances, tourists can pay for goods and services in U.S. dollars or other hard currency. ATMs are available at the international airport and around the major tourist destinations of Mahe, Praslin and La Digue, but they dispense only Seychellois Rupees. Credit cards are not necessarily widely accepted outside of resorts. Gas stations and smaller, more remote outlets usually only accept cash.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  While consensual same sex relations are legal in the Seychelles, LGB persons have reported instances of discrimination.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section six of our  Human Rights report  for further details. \n \n Travelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, accommodations, and public buildings.

Roads on both islands are narrow and wind steeply over mountains, often with sheer drops and hairpin bends. Many roads are not well-maintained, have minimal lighting, and many drivers do not necessarily adhere to traffic regulations. Traffic safety is hazardous due to a lack of safety barriers and inadequate street lighting. Avoid remote roads, particularly at night.  Drunk-driving is a problem, so be particularly aware of other road users who may behave recklessly.\nTraffic Laws:  You will need an international driving permit to drive in the Seychelles. Cars drive on the left. Drivers and front-seat passengers are required to wear seatbelts. Car rentals are available. Most car rental companies will include an excess as part of the rental fee, which will cover a certain amount of damage.

Some taxis are not metered, so confirm with your hotel about fares you should expect on trips.\nFerry/Water Transport:  Most of the inner islands are accessible by boat or ferry; there are also a number of day trips available to tourists. Check that there is sufficient safety equipment including life jackets and ship to shore radio.  Travel by ship to the outer islands including the Amirantes, Cosmoledo and Aldabra groups requires prior approval from the Seychelles Maritime Safety Authority.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of Seychelles’  national tourist office  and national authority responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Seychelles, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Seychelles’ Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

Although the U.S. Embassy is not aware of any recent prosecutions for consensual sexual activity between men, such activity is illegal and penalties can include imprisonment. While there is no explicit legal prohibition against sexual relations between women, lesbians of all ages can be victims of “planned rapes” initiated by family members in an effort to change their sexual orientation.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Sierra Leone does not prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities and offers no specific protections for such persons.

Guided or group tours are generally safer than traveling alone. Landowners may demand money if you enter their land without permission. Home invasions, burglaries, and violent crime typically increase in the months approaching the Christmas holiday season. Yacht-related robberies can occur, usually at night while occupants are asleep. Most criminals are not deterred even when boats are anchored offshore. Visiting yachts should be wary of allowing strangers onboard and boaters should take precautions when leaving the vessel to go ashore.\nGeneral Safety:  You should travel in groups for safety and security, especially in the evening or at night. All water activities should be done in groups. Swimmers should be aware of saltwater crocodiles that can be found at the mouths of rivers emptying into the sea.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nLocal customary law is still observed in Solomon Islands, especially in rural areas. Disputes based in customary law are generally resolved through a compensation-based settlement mediated by law enforcement or local government officials. Some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. \nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consular Agency immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCustoms:  The Solomon Islands' customs authorities enforce strict regulations for importing or exporting firearms and ammunition, pornography, and certain prescription drugs. Other items may be subject to quarantine regulations or import duty. The Solomon Islands' government prohibits the export of military artifacts from World War II. Contact the  Solomon Islands' Mission to the United Nations  for specific information regarding customs requirements.\nUnexploded Ordnance:  Unexploded World War II ordnance remains in the Solomon Islands, particularly in the areas of Hell’s Point, the ridges behind Honiara, the New Georgia group of islands, Tulagi, and the Russel Islands. Be alert when hiking, boating, or diving. Be vigilant for ordnance and obey all posted warnings.\nNatural Disasters:  Solomon Islands is subject to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and sudden tidal movements (tsunamis).

Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. \nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation, as medical evacuation to Australia, New Zealand, or the United States can cost thousands of dollars.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nTravelers arriving from measles-affected countries must provide proof of measles vaccination administered no less than three weeks prior to arrival in Solomon Islands. For the purposes of this requirement, measles-affected countries include American Samoa, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Philippines. This requirement does not apply to infants under six months of age, pregnant women, or to other travelers with documentary evidence of contraindications to measles vaccine administration.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the dry season. People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include: \nContact the U.S. Consular Agency in Honiara for a list of doctors and hospitals. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nHealth facilities in general:\nSpecialized care for scuba divers:\nPharmaceuticals \nWater Quality \nAdventure Travel \nGeneral Health Language\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Resources for Travelers  regarding specific issues in Solomon Islands.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic in Solomon Islands moves on the left side of the road. Paved roads are found only in and around Honiara. These two-lane paved roads are poorly marked and have many potholes. Roads are not well lit at night. The remaining roads in Solomon Islands are made of coral, gravel, or are dirt tracks.\nTraffic Laws:  If you are involved in a road accident, local law requires you to stop and stay at the scene until the police arrive. If a crowd gathers after an accident and you feel threatened, proceed directly to a police station. Incidents of individuals being harmed by crowds as a result of a traffic accident are rare.\nMost local drivers are not well trained and do not follow basic traffic laws. Be aware of drivers under the influence of alcohol, of pedestrians who are not aware of traffic, and of children running out into the road. Police control of traffic is limited, even in Honiara. When driving be alert at all times. Street signs and traffic lights are scarce or may not be in working order. \nPublic Transportation:  Taxi services in Honiara and Auki are widely available and are generally safe. Public bus and mini-bus services are also available, but safety standards may vary widely and information on routes may not be available in a published form. Incidences of petty theft are more frequent on public transportation. While greater government regulation and oversight has led to an increase in safety of ferry services, be aware that safety standards may still vary widely and amenities onboard are often extremely limited.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. For more information, visit the website of Solomon Islands’  national tourist office  or contact the traffic police at (+677) 25567 or (+677) 22336. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in the Solomon Islands, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Solomon Islands’ Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

U.S. citizens can contact the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya. In an emergency, you will have to rely on your own resources or journey to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate outside of Somalia.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: \nTerrorist organizations and armed groups in Somalia attack government authorities and facilities; African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) personnel and bases; and civilian and non-governmental targets, including but not limited to hotels, restaurants, airports, seaports, and shopping areas. Inter-clan and factional violence are also regular occurrences throughout Somalia.\nAl-Shabaab, an al-Qa’ida-affiliated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia, has repeatedly attacked Mogadishu’s Aden Adde International Airport (AAIA) and other locations in Somalia with mortars, small arms and light weapons, and vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). The group’s recent attacks include a March 23, 2022, small arms and mortar attack at the AAIA compound in Mogadishu, where the U.S. Embassy, several other diplomatic posts, and the UN offices are based, which killed seven people. Later the same day, two attacks in Beledweyne killed 48 and wounded 108. On January 12, 2022, a VBIED motorcade attack approximately four kilometers from the U.S. Embassy injured two U.S. citizen contractors and killed five non-U.S. citizen employees providing security and killed an unconfirmed number of bystanders. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for all of these attacks. While some areas have experienced less severe terrorist activity, such as the Somaliland region, where there have been no major terrorist attacks since 2008, terrorist attacks involving the indiscriminate use of explosive devices and other weapons can take place anywhere in Somalia at any time without warning.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:  Violent crime such as kidnapping, bombings, indirect fire attacks, murder, armed robbery, carjacking, and illegal roadblocks by armed individuals in uniforms occur throughout Somalia, including the self-declared autonomous region of Somaliland. Somali authorities have limited capacity and resources to investigate and prosecute criminal activity.\nU.S. citizens should:\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\nCultural Rehabilitation Centers:  Some schools and other facilities acting as “cultural rehabilitation” centers are operating in Somalia with inadequate or nonexistent licensing and oversight. Reports of minors and young adults being held in these facilities against their will and physically abused are common.\nSomalia-Kenya Border:  Cross-border violence attributed to al-Shabaab and skirmishes between the Somali and Kenyan armies occurs periodically, including large-scale attacks against civilians, government security forces, and AMISOM troops. Kidnapping, IED, and grenade attacks targeting international aid workers and civilians occur. Al-Shabaab actively operates in border areas, including Kenya’s Lamu and Wajir counties.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and  FBI   pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Kenya for assistance. Report crimes to the nearest local police and contact the U.S. Embassy in Kenya at (254) (20) 363-6451 during business hours or (254) (20) 363-6000 outside business hours. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Kenya for assistance.\nTourism:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure exists in Somalia. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment are not available in Somalia. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. You may be taken in for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs result in long prison sentences and heavy fines.\nLocal courts operate under a combination of Somali customary and Islamic law, some of which may be hostile towards foreigners.\nIndividuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the relevant local authorities prior to practicing a profession or operating a business. \nFurthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification : Somali law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign and dual nationals in detention. The U.S. Embassy in Kenya may not receive notification or be allowed access to you if you are detained. Furthermore, dual U.S.-Somali citizens are recognized as Somali citizens by authorities, which impedes our ability to provide any consular assistance. If you are arrested or detained, ask Somali police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in Kenya immediately. The U.S. government’s ability to provide consular services across Somalia is severely restricted due to ongoing security concerns and the lack of a permanent consular presence in Somalia, including the Somaliland region See our  webpage  for further information.\nPhotography:  Do not take pictures of government buildings, military installations, or key infrastructure such as airports and border controls. You could be detained or arrested, fined, and have your equipment confiscated. Do not take photos of people without their permission.\nPhone Service:  Cellular phones are used extensively. SIM cards can be purchased locally and used with a compatible cell phone.\nCurrency:  The Somali shilling is the unit of currency except in the Somaliland region, which uses the Somaliland shilling. Be advised that most Somali shillings in circulation are believed to be counterfeit. U.S. dollars are widely accepted. Credit cards and traveler's checks are generally not accepted, and you are advised against using your credit card in Somalia, even if accepted. It is not possible to obtain currency advances against a credit card. ATMs are increasingly available in Mogadishu. ATMs in Somalia disburse U.S. dollars.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Same-sex sexual contact is punishable by three months to three years in prison. Anti-discrimination provisions do not apply to LGB individuals. Society considers sexual orientation a taboo topic, so there is no known public discussion of this issue. Severe societal stigma typically prevents LGB individuals from making their sexual orientation publicly known.\nSee our  LGB travel information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The provisional constitution prohibits the state from discriminating against any person on the basis of disability. However, it makes no reference to discrimination in the private sector. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Few government buildings, schools, banks, or grocery stores have accessible facilities, including in Mogadishu. Some hospitals and clinics are equally inaccessible to people with disabilities and lack wheelchair ramps or lifts, including some of the hospitals travelers commonly use. Expect accessibility to be very limited in transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure, and largely absent outside of major cities. \nMuch of the disability equipment for sale locally is refurbished rather than new. Replacement parts can be found in local informal markets and are also generally refurbished parts. Imported higher-end equipment such as electric wheelchairs and lifting equipment can be purchased from a very limited number of medical equipment suppliers in the major cities. Almost all supplies must be purchased and imported from overseas.\nStudents:  See our  students abroad  page and  FBI travel tips . We are aware of allegations that some boarding schools in Somalia engage in abusive practices such as corporal punishment, physical restraint, and confiscation of travel documents.\nYouth:  We are aware of cases of forced marriage. Some facilities involved in “cultural rehabilitation” (“dhaqan celis,” meaning “returning to Somali culture”) engage in abusive practices such as corporal punishment, physical restraint, and confiscation of travel documents.\nWomen Travelers:  There are no laws against spousal violence, including rape. There are documented patterns of rape perpetrated with impunity, particularly of displaced women and members of minority clans. Authorities rarely use formal structures to address rape. Survivors suffer from subsequent discrimination based on the attribution of “impurity.” Domestic and sexual violence against women remain serious problems, despite the provisional federal constitution provision prohibiting any form of violence against women. See our travel tips for  women travelers .\nFemale Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C):  Although the provisional federal constitution prohibits the circumcision of girls, FGM/C is almost universally practiced throughout the country. Up to 98 percent of women and girls have reportedly undergone FGM/C, primarily between the ages of 5 and 14 years.\nWater, health, and electricity systems in Somalia are poor.\nMedical care and services are extremely limited. Medicines are in short supply, and many pharmacies stock ineffective or counterfeit medications. Most care providers expect payment in U.S. dollars/Somali shillings prior to treatment.\nAmbulance services are not present or are unreliable in most areas except Mogadishu. Somalia Red Crescent Society services may be available in some areas in case of disasters/emergency.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on the type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation. Medical evacuation services in Somalia are extremely limited, and services responding from outside of the country will take more than six hours to respond.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the Somali  Ministry of Health  to ensure the medication is legal in Somalia. \nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIf you will be in Somalia for more than four weeks, the Somali government may require you to show proof of polio vaccination when you are exiting the country. If you were vaccinated against polio as a child but have never had a polio booster dose as an adult, or if you were not completely vaccinated as a child/do not know your vaccination status, talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated. To meet this requirement while in Somalia, you should receive a polio vaccine between 4 weeks and 12 months before the date you are leaving Somalia. Talk to your doctor about whether this requirement applies to you.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. embassies and consulates. \nHealth facilities in general \nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nFood-borne and water-borne illnesses are common. \nUse the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended mosquito repellents and sleep under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all travelers even for short stays.\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  resources for travelers  regarding  specific issues in Somalia .\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions are poor. Night driving is particularly dangerous due to the absence of lighting and terrorist- or militia-operated checkpoints. Other risks include lack of traffic lights and pedestrians and animals in the road. Refer to our  road safety page  for more information. The U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from traveling outside the AAIA compound or using public transportation due to safety concerns.\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Somalia, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Somalia’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nThe FAA has issued a Notice to Air Mission containing information on the U.S. prohibition against U.S. civil aviation operations in airspace over Somalia. For background information and advisories consult the  Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices .\nThe U.S. Embassy prohibits its employees from using commercial airlines originating from or arriving in Somalia due to safety concerns.\nMaritime Travel:  Information may be posted at  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts ,  the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration , the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings .\nPort Security:  The Commandant of the Coast Guard is unable to determine if effective anti-terrorism measures are in place in Somalia ports as required by 46 U.S. Code § 70108.”"

Visit the  Department of Home Affairs  website for the most up-to-date requirements for traveling with minors to or from South Africa.\nImmunizations:  Travelers entering South Africa from WHO-designated countries with risk of yellow fever virus (YFV) transmission must present their current and valid International Certificate of Vaccination as approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) (“yellow card”). See the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s South Africa page .\nThe U.S. Department of State is not aware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of South Africa. However, South Africa has a high HIV/AIDS prevalence.\nOther:  Find information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nAlerts regarding important safety and security information such as demonstrations, road security, and weather events are posted on the  Embassy’s website .\nIn South Africa the equivalent to the “911” emergency line is 10111.\nThe following paragraphs provide a summary, but please read the Department of State’s most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council  Country Security Report  on South Africa, which provides detailed information about safety and security concerns for travelers to South Africa.\nCivil Unrest: \n Strikes and demonstrations occur frequently. These can develop quickly without prior notification and occasionally turn violent, and may include the burning of vehicles, buildings, or tires – which may serve as roadblocks; throwing rocks or other objects; or physical attacks. Strikes and demonstrations can also interrupt traffic and the provision of electricity, water, public transportation, fuel, and other goods and services. Periodic incidents of mob violence directed against refugees and immigrants from other African countries occur in South Africa. During labor protests, strike breakers or those perceived to be strike breakers have been violently attacked. Protests involving taxis and ride hailing services can turn violent. See Travel and Transportation section below for guidance.\nPrecautions:\nCrime: \n Crime in South Africa is very high. Violent crimes happen in places where people live, work, travel, or go out. This includes armed home invasions by criminal groups, which lead to assaults, rapes, and murder. Popular tourist spots and big hotels have their own security to prevent these incidents. But visitors and residents are still affected by armed robbery, rape, kidnapping, carjacking, mugging, and \"smash-and-grab\" attacks on vehicles. It's important to be extra careful at traffic lights and on/off ramps where cars slow down or stop. To avoid being robbed when buying jewelry or electronics outside high-end stores, many vendors offer to deliver your purchase to your home or hotel for a fee. Crime can happen anywhere and at any time, even in and around Kruger National Park. U.S. government staff and visitors have been robbed near our diplomatic facilities. It's especially important to be cautious in the central business districts (CBDs) of major cities, especially after dark. Crime victims have also been followed from OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg and then robbed when they reach their home or hotel. \nTheft can be bold and in broad daylight. Travelers and U.S. diplomats report having cell phones stolen from their hands, as well as purses or wallets taken off counters while paying for goods at stores. Car theft and hijacking continues to plague the country, particularly in large cities. Travelers should choose secure parking options and double check locked doors before leaving a parked car.\nThroughout South Africa, U.S. citizens should:\nStudent Groups:  There have been instances of student groups being robbed while conducting outreach and service visits in townships. On these occasions, student groups coordinated with officials to conduct service visits and upon arrival were held and then robbed by armed perpetrators.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\nInternet romance and financial scams  are prevalent in South Africa. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.\nTips to avoid scammers:\n• Look for red flags such as individuals who say they live in a remote location, a profile that was recently created or seems to be too good to be true, the pace of the relationship is moving too quickly, or requests for money.\nCommon scams include:\nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobile devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices prior to traveling abroad include keeping all software (for operating systems and apps) updated and using virtual private network (VPN) and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.\nGPS navigation apps . Prior to using the GPS navigation apps, make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation apps may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.\nDating apps and websites . Be careful when using dating apps and online dating websites in foreign countries as scammers may target U.S. citizens. Let your friends and family know where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid eating or drinking anything suspicious. Don't go to bars or nightclubs alone. \nCredit cards and ATMs.  Travelers need not surrender their credit card to any vendor. They will bring a credit card machine to customers.\nBe cautious when using ATMs outside of banks and reputable hotels because ATM and Credit Card skimming is common. Thieves may pretend to help you use a malfunctioning ATM and steal your ATM cards. Skimmers have also been found on machines used to pay parking tickets at shopping malls and office buildings. To avoid this risk, pay parking fees with cash. \nSee the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence should report crimes to the local police at 10111. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nThe U.S. Consulates General in South Africa can:\nTerrorism Threat:  Extremists with ties to international terrorist organizations, such as al-Qai’ida, al-Shabaab, and ISIS, historically have used South Africa as a logistical hub to conduct recruitment and financial facilitation. There has been increased activity by ISIS sympathizers and supporters locally, including the placement of incendiary devices and kidnapping for ransom operations. South African authorities have periodically arrested individuals and charged them with terrorism related crimes. The U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has publicly designated ISIS members operating in South Africa who have provided technical, financial, or material support to the terrorist group. Check the  Mission’s website  to review Alerts to U.S. citizens, and  register  with the U.S. Mission to South Africa to receive new Alerts by email during your travels.\nFor more information, see our Terrorism page.\nGame parks and outdoor safety:  Visitors have been injured and killed by wild animals in South Africa. It is dangerous to leave your vehicle in game parks outside of designated areas. Observe all park regulations and follow the instructions of guides. Be mindful of sharks when swimming. Rip tides are common and very dangerous. Do not swim alone in isolated areas or dive into unfamiliar waters.\nHikers must be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions and ensure they have proper clothing and supplies. Many areas, especially in the Western Cape province, experience brush fires during the summer months (December-February). These fires can burn for several days. Monitor local media and follow fire crew instructions regarding road closures and evacuations.\n \nTourism:  The tourism industry is regulated. Rules for best practices and safety inspections are enforced. Hazardous areas are marked with signs and professional staff are available for organized activities. If you get hurt, there is medical treatment available. Outside of big cities, it might take longer for help to come. It's a good idea for U.S. citizens to get medical evacuation insurance. U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance.\nSee our webpage for more information on  insurance providers for overseas coverage .\n \nInfrastructure:  In the country, there are often scheduled blackouts called \"Load Shedding\". These blackouts are meant to protect the electrical grid, but they cause the whole country to lose power for up to six hours every day. This is bad for businesses that don't have another way to get power, like hotels. Load shedding also causes traffic lights to stop working, which leads to traffic jams and more crime. It can also affect access to water, cell phone signal, fuel availability, and safety features in rural areas. \nCriminal Penalties:  If you break local laws, even if you don't know, you can be deported, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or do a job that needs special permission, you should ask the local authorities for information before you start.\nSome crimes can also be punished in the United States, even if they are not against local law.   For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice website .\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or held, ask police or prison officials to notify the nearest U.S. Consulate in South Africa  immediately . See our  webpage  for further information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website  and  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers: See our following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in South Africa.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  South Africa law mandates access to buildings for persons with disabilities, but these laws are rarely enforced. Some tourist attractions, and restaurants near tourist attractions, are equipped with ramps and other options to facilitate access. Conditions vary significantly across the country.\nThe law in South Africa prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual and mental disabilities, and the law is enforced unevenly. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual assault and gender-based violence in the world. Women travelers should take special care to follow safety and security precautions listed on this page when traveling in South Africa    \nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nSpecial Circumstances:  Parts of South Africa may face drought conditions, water scarcity, and rainfall patterns that may be erratic. Water supplies in some areas may be affected. Water-use restrictions may be in place in the affected municipalities.\nFor emergency services in South Africa, dial  10111 . Ambulance services are:\nWe highly recommend that all travelers review the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  Travelers’ Health webpage  and general  Traveler Advice  for South Africa.\nPrivate medical facilities are good in urban areas and in the vicinity of game parks but limited elsewhere. Private medical facilities require a deposit before admitting patients. Pharmacies are well-stocked, but you should carry an adequate supply of prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. HIV and AIDS is a major public health concern.\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Private medical facilities will require payment before care is administered. See   insurance providers for overseas coverage . Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nIf your health insurance plan does not provide coverage overseas, we strongly recommend your  Health Abroad .\nIf traveling with prescription medication, check with the  Embassy of South Africa  to ensure the medication is legal in South Africa. Always, carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nVaccinations:  Be up to date on  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFor further health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  Air Now Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nAir pollution is a significant problem in several major cities in South Africa. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.\nThe air quality varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons. It is typically at its worst in the Winter (Southern Hemisphere). People at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:\n \nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery\n \nMedical tourism is a rapidly growing industry. People seeking health care overseas should understand that medical systems operate differently from those in the United States and are not subject to the same rules and regulations. Anyone interested in traveling for medical purposes should consult with their local physician before traveling and visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website  for more information on Medical Tourism.\nVisit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website  for information on Medical Tourism, the risks of medical tourism, and what you can do to prepare before traveling to South Africa.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation in the event of unforeseen medical complications.\nYour legal options in case of malpractice are very limited in South Africa.\nAlthough South Africa has many elective/cosmetic surgery facilities that are on par with those found in the United States, the quality of care varies widely. If you plan to undergo surgery in South Africa, make sure that emergency medical facilities are available, and professionals are accredited and qualified.\nPharmaceuticals\nExercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, both over the counter and requiring prescriptions, are often readily available for purchase with minimal regulation. Counterfeit medication is common and may be ineffective, the wrong strength, or contain dangerous ingredients. Medication should be purchased in consultation with a medical professional and from reputable establishments.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and the  Food and Drug Administration  websites for more information.\nWater Quality & Food Safety\nIn many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe, although you should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\n \nAltitude\nJohannesburg is at high altitude (5,751 feet). Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness and take precautions before you travel. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Travel to High Altitudes .\n \nAdventure Travel\nVisit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Adventure Travel .\n \nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions are generally good in South Africa, but the road traffic death rate is nearly three times higher in South Africa than in the United States. The high incidence of road traffic mortality is due to a combination of poor driving, limited enforcement of traffic laws, road rage, aggressive driving, distracted driving, and driving under the influence of alcohol. Use extreme caution driving at night. U.S. government employees are discouraged from driving after dark outside of major metropolitan areas, except for highway travel between Pretoria and Johannesburg. Traffic lights are frequently out of order.\nTraffic Laws:  Traffic in South Africa moves on the left, and the steering wheel is on the right-hand side of the car. Under South African law, all occupants of motor vehicles equipped with seatbelts are required to wear them while the vehicle is in operation. Texting or talking on a cell phone without a hands-free unit while driving is illegal. Treat all intersections with malfunctioning traffic lights as a four-way stop.\nSouth African law does not require an international driver’s license. A valid driver’s license from any U.S. state or territory that has the signature and photo of the driver is valid to drive in South Africa for stays of less than six months.\nPlease refer to the  Road Safety page  for more information. Also, visit the websites of  South African Tourism  and the  South African National Roads Agency  for more information regarding local transportation trends and laws.\nPublic Transportation:\nTaxis:  The use of individual metered taxis dispatched from established taxi companies, hotel taxis, and tour buses is recommended. U.S. government personnel are not allowed to use minibus taxis or hail taxis on the street or use a taxi stand. Minibus taxi drivers are often unlicensed and drive erratically.\nTransportation Network Companies:  Transportation Network Companies (TNCs), such as Uber, also operate in South Africa. U.S. government personnel may only use TNCs with a dispatch application that provides vehicle description, license plate number, and the driver’s name, picture, user rating, and the ability to share trip information. The user should verify the information provided by the company, such as the vehicle make/model, license plate number, and driver’s name/picture, prior to entering the vehicle. TNCs should not be used to travel outside major metropolitan areas. Pick up and drop off should not be done near a traditional taxi stand due to tensions between rideshare and taxi drivers that have resulted in altercations.\nRail Service:  The long-distance rail service, Shosholoza Meyl; the rapid rail Gautrain in Gauteng Province; and luxury rail services, such as Shosholoza Meyl Premier Classe, Blue Train, and Rovos Rail are generally safe and reliable, though mechanical problems and criminal incidents do sometimes occur. U.S. government personnel are not allowed to use the Metrorail commuter rail service because of safety and crime concerns. There have been recent reports of fires being set on Metrorail train cars.\nSee our Road Safety page for more information. Visit the website of South Africa’s  Road Safety  authority and Traffic Management Corporation. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of South Africa’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards for oversight of South Africa’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to South Africa should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories  and  alerts  on the Maritime Administration website.

See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nSouth Sudan’s security services commit arbitrary arrests and often detain foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens. Extortion is common.\nSecurity forces often operate outside civilian control and do not always follow laws governing due process and treatment of detainees.\nU.S. citizens may have little recourse to justice should they be detained. Legal proceedings can be lengthy and subjective.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nSouth Sudanese law enforcement officials routinely block access to foreign nationals and dual nationals in detention.  \nIf you have reason to believe a U.S. citizen may be detained or incarcerated in South Sudan, do not assume the Embassy is already aware. Contact the Embassy and provide as much information as possible.\nJournalism:  Reporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan and have been killed while covering the conflict. They have also reported being detained with no due process or deported from the country with no warning.\nControlled Items:  Certain items which are normal and legal to possess elsewhere are tightly controlled in South Sudan. Bringing them into the country without government permission, or even traveling internally with them, can result in extra scrutiny by security officials, the confiscation of your items, and your arrest.\nMetal detectors, which can be used for prospecting, are tightly controlled, especially if you are traveling to an area where mining takes place. Some forms of communication equipment such as satellite phones (commonly referred to by their trade names: Thurayas or Iridiums) are required to be registered with the government. Imports of any form of military material or “dual-use” items including their components are highly scrutinized, even if commercially available; this includes commercial drones.\nU.S. citizens should contact the  Embassy of the Republic of South Sudan  for questions regarding what equipment they may or may not import into the country and how to obtain authorizations for specific equipment or to bring in large sums of cash.\nDual Nationals:  The Embassy recommends all dual nationals obtain visas for their U.S. passport covering the duration of their stay in South Sudan. If staying longer than a typical visa will allow, dual nationals are strongly encouraged to obtain a five-year residency permit. These documents are available for a fee at any local Government of South Sudan Immigration office.\nAid Workers:  Consult with the security personnel representing your organization. Compounds housing aid workers have been breached and aid workers, including U.S. citizens, have been the targets of shootings, ambushes, violent assaults, harassment, and robberies.\nCurrency:  The South Sudanese pound (SSP) is the official currency. It is a cash exclusive society. Carry sufficient funds in to cover all your expenses for the duration of your stay. ATMs draw on local banks only. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. U.S. currency that is damaged or issued prior to 2006 is not accepted.\nPhotography:  For any photography, amateur and professional, a permit is required and may be obtained from the Ministry of Interior for $50. Even with a permit, you must be careful taking pictures, as police have arrested and physically assaulted tourists for using a camera. In addition, traveling with professional photography equipment will trigger extra scrutiny regardless of occupation.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Same-sex sexual relations are considered illegal in South Sudan with penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment, if consensual. If non-consensual, the penalty is up to 14 years’ imprisonment. Societal discrimination against LGB persons is widespread, and there are no known LGB organizations.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:   Persons with disabilities face limited access to transportation, public buildings, hotels, and communication accommodations. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack elevators.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Women suffer from high levels of sexual violence, including abduction, rape, and forced marriage. The law does not prohibit domestic violence. Spousal abuse is common and police seldom intervene.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in South Sudan, dial 999.\nFor Public Health Emergency Services (currently used for COVID), dial 6666.\nAmbulance services are not present throughout the country.\nMedical facilities  in Juba fall far short of western standards. Outside Juba, the few hospitals and clinics that exist are poorly equipped and staffed.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with South Sudanese customs to ensure the medication is legal in South Sudan.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:\nPharmaceuticals:\nWater Quality:\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   There are very few paved roads; most are narrow, rutted, and poorly maintained. Roads are often impassable during the rainy season (March to November). Pedestrians and animals in the roadways, excessive speed, erratic driving, lack of street lights, and overloaded or poorly maintained vehicles pose additional risks.\nWhen driving in remote areas, travel during daylight hours only and use convoys of multiple vehicles to mitigate the threat of roadside criminals. Carry spare tires, parts, fuel, and provisions. Service stations are separated by long distances. Professional roadside assistance service is not available.\nCheckpoints:  Approach all vehicle checkpoints with caution, especially after dark or during times of heightened political or military tensions, and do not attempt to evade them. Even stops at checkpoints operated by the government of South Sudan may become hostile or violent.\nKeep car doors locked at all times to prevent carjacking and vehicle intrusion. Only roll car windows down enough to communicate when necessary. Anyone staffing checkpoints will often solicit bribes. Display requested documents, but do not surrender them, as officials may take them if bribes are not paid. You may wish to keep a laminated copy of your documents with you that can be shown in place of your actual passports or identification cards.\nLandmines:  Years of conflict have left the threat of unexploded ordnance, including landmines, as a hazard on or near major roads. Stay on main roads marked as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.\nTraffic Laws:  An international driver's license and third-party liability insurance from the government is required. Those convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol face fines, jail sentences, and corporal punishment.\nAccidents:  If involved in an accident resulting in death or injury, report the incident to the nearest police station or police officer as soon as possible. Remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene and proceed directly to the nearest police station to report the incident. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly. Many local drivers are uninsured.\nPublic Transportation:  You should hire private transportation from a reputable source. The use of public transportation (small buses, vans, or motorbike taxis “boda-bodas”) is off-limits to U.S. Embassy personnel and should be avoided whenever possible. Drivers of these vehicles frequently have little training and are reckless, and the vehicles are often poorly maintained. Schedules are unpublished and subject to change without notice. There is some public transit to rural communities by irregularly scheduled mini-buses.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in South Sudan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of South Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page ."

This means that U.S. citizens may enter Spain for up to 90 days for tourism or business without a visa. Your passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay. You must have sufficient funds and a return airline ticket. Visit the  Embassy of Spain  website for the most current visa information.\nTraveling Through Europe : If you are planning to visit, transit and/or travel through European countries, you should be familiar with the requirements of the Schengen Agreement. \nStudents and athletes:  Students, prospective students, and athletes should visit the  Embassy of Spain  website for additional information on entry requirements. You should not travel to Spain as a student or for an athletic/study program without the appropriate Spanish visa. U.S. citizen students and athletes have been denied entry and held in immigration detention at Spanish airports awaiting return flights to the United States because they lacked the appropriate visa. If your coach or sponsoring program says that you do not require a visa to study, play for a sports team, or participate in a sports training program in Spain, you should confirm this information with the nearest Spanish consulate in the United States before you travel.\nU.S. citizen minors living in Spain:  Spanish law mandates that all Spanish minors traveling internationally without their parents or legal guardians must have written notarized permission from a parent or guardian. The law also applies to foreign, minor residents if their country of nationality also requires parental permission. While U.S. law does not require minors traveling without a parent/guardian to have the parents’/guardians’ written permission, Spanish authorities and airlines have occasionally misinterpreted the law and stopped U.S. citizens minors from departing the country. Therefore, parents/legal guardians should consider preparing a notarized, written permission for their U.S. citizen minor children to travel abroad unaccompanied or with a third party.\nHIV/AIDS restrictions:   The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Spain.  \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on encouraging or conducting attacks worldwide, including within Europe. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: \nSpain’s open borders with its Western European neighbors allow the possibility for terrorists to enter and exit the country anonymously. Additionally, Spain’s enclaves in Melilla and Ceuta on the North African coast allow for entry into Spain from the African continent. Spain has taken robust actions to guard against terrorist attacks, including arrests of suspected extremists allegedly involved in terrorist plots. Credible information indicates terrorist groups continue to plot potential attacks in Europe, including Spain.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.  \nCrime:  Pickpocketing and other minor crimes, such as theft, are very common in Spain including instances where the victim is purposefully distracted to facilitate the theft. Street crimes against U.S. citizens usually occur in  tourist areas, including airports, train stations, and both urban and beach destinations .\nViolent crimes, including robberies, have also been reported. Some instances have required the victim to seek medical attention. Car break-ins are also frequent in Spain.\nUse common sense, awareness and the same personal security measures you would normally use in any large city or tourist destination.\nKeep track of your passport at all times, including on flights and other modes of transportation. There have been reports of passports being stolen on planes en route to Spain. Do not leave bags unattended. Keep them in sight and avoid placing passports, cash, cell phones, or other valuables in the outer pockets of backpacks or purses on tables or floors, grounds in public places. Do not leave bags slung over the backs of chairs, on hotel or store counters, on top of your suitcase or travel bag, or out of your physical control in hotel lobbies, car rental locations, train stations, restaurants, and other public places. Avoid carrying your passport unless needed for travel, especially in tourist areas. Instead, carry a photocopy or photo of your passport’s biographical information page and consider leaving your passport in a secure location, such as a hotel safe. Your passport will be required to check in into any hotel in Spain and may be required for trains or tourist sites.\nSexual Assault:  The U.S. Mission in Spain has received numerous reports of sexual assaults affecting U.S. citizens, especially younger travelers, students, and exchange teachers.\nNavigating the Spanish criminal justice system after surviving a sexual assault has been difficult for many U.S. citizen victims, who report feeling judged and re-victimized throughout the very lengthy process.\nAlthough it is not required, many U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault in Spain have found it helpful to hire a local attorney to be their advocate and defend their rights during any judicial process or use the help of the local Office of Victim’s Assistance. Information about the local victim’s assistance program is given out at the police station when the report is filed.\nThere have been numerous reports alleging sexual assaults against U.S. citizen students by Manuel Blanco Vela, a representative of a tour operator based in Seville, Spain. Conduct research online to determine who owns and operates tour companies to make informed choices.\nMany sexual assaults occur at night or during the early morning hours. In most cases, assailants take advantage of alcohol or drugs to make victims more vulnerable.\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should call the toll-free emergency number in Spain, 016, for assistance, and the U.S. Embassy in Madrid at (34) 91-587-2200 or U.S. Consulate General Barcelona at (+34) 93-280-2227. Note that the local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence, sexual assault or other violent crimes are encouraged to report crimes to the local emergency services at 112 and contact the  U.S. Embassy, Consulate, or consular agency for assistance . Note that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\n \nWe can:\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events. \n \nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nFinancial scams are prevalent in Spain. Beware of anyone asking for money, particularly people who establish a “romantic” relationship online or anyone who claims the Spanish authorities are asking them for money. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:   \nTourism:  The tourism industry is generally regulated, and rules [with regards to best practices and safety inspections] are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage, and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. \nFurthermore, some violations of laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs in Spain are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines.\nMost cities in Spain have banned the consumption of alcohol in the street, other than in registered street cafes and bars. You could be arrested or fined if you break the law.\nLocal police, sometimes dressed in plain clothes, can require you to produce identification to establish your identity upon request and detain you for further questioning. Carry a photocopy of your passport with you as proof of your identity. If you are stopped by someone who claims to be a plainclothes police officer, ask to see their law enforcement identification.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police to notify the U.S. Embassy Madrid or U.S. Consulate General Barcelona immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also have to pay fines or have to give them up if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information. \nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Spain. \nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.  \nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Spain prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. In general, public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure are accessible. Taxis that can accommodate wheelchairs are available, but usually must be booked in advance.\nIn historic areas and older areas, sidewalks can be narrow and have uneven surfaces. Take this into account when planning your visit.  There may be differences in small towns and villages, where accessibility may be more limited.\nRental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants are widely available in Spain.\nStudents:  Follow the tips below and exercise caution and good judgment to make your study-abroad experience a positive and safe one. If you are coming to Spain to participate in a sports program, please check with the  Embassy of Spain  that you have the correct visa.\nDo your research before contracting a tour operator or other service provider, including coaches and organizers of sports camps, schools, and training centers.\nExercise caution when agreeing to an internship or to serve as a recruiter for a specific organization or company. Most arrests, accidents, and violent crimes U.S. citizens suffer in Spain involve excessive alcohol. Drink in moderation and stay in a group of friends when in clubs, bars, or traveling.\nSee our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers : The U.S. Mission in Spain has received numerous reports of sexual assaults affecting U.S. citizens, especially younger travelers, students, and exchange teachers. Please see more information under Safety and Security.  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nGood medical care is available in Spain. However, regulations regarding medications vary from those in the United States. Spanish regulations do not permit the international shipment of medication . Do not ship medication from the United States to Spain . Spanish customs authorities will reject and return to the shipper medication mailed from the United States. This may cause a significant delay in receiving your medications. The U.S. Embassy cannot help you retrieve medications stopped by Spanish customs.\nMedications requiring prescriptions in the United States also require a local doctor’s prescription in Spain. In some instances, a medicine prescribed in the United States will not have a local equivalent. It is important that travelers research this on the  European Agency for Medication  website prior to travel.\nFor emergency services in Spain, dial 112. You may ask for an English-speaking attendant.\nAmbulance services are widely available. \nWe do not pay medical bills . Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. Medical care is not free in Spain. If you require medical attention, you will incur expenses, even if you are treated in a public healthcare facility. Lack of payment may bar future travel to Spain.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. We strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. \nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with the  embassy  to ensure the medication is legal in Spain. \nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains  a list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nHealth facilities in general:\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery:\nPharmaceuticals: \n  U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration are responsible for rules governing the transport of medication back to the United States. Medication purchased abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back into the United States. Medication should be for personal use and must be approved for usage in the United States. Please visit the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and the  Food and Drug Administration  websites for more information.\nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy: \n  If you are considering traveling to Spain to have a child through use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or surrogacy, please see our  ART and Surrogacy Abroad page . \nSurrogacy is illegal in Spain and subject to complex local regulation. \nAdventure Travel: \n  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Adventure Travel .\nRoad Conditions and Safety : Road conditions in Spain can differ significantly from those in the United States. Drivers and pedestrians should exercise increased caution as traffic in Madrid and Barcelona is often faster-paced than in the United States and can be unnerving because of unfamiliar signs and traffic lights and different driving habits, including motorbikes weaving between traffic lanes.\nObey the traffic light located at your stop line, as there are separate traffic lights for each side of the intersection. Be alert when driving at night in urban areas; you may encounter drivers or pedestrians under the influence of alcohol.\nNight driving in isolated rural areas can be dangerous because of farm animals and poorly marked roads.\nRural traffic is generally heavier in July and August as well as during the Christmas and Easter seasons.\nEmergency services, including roadside assistance, are plentiful, competent, and can be easily accessed by dialing 112 from any phone.\nTraffic Laws:  You must obtain an International Driving Permit prior to your arrival if you plan to drive in Spain. The permits are only valid for one year.\nIt is illegal to rent a vehicle if you don’t have an International Driving Permit. Your rental car may be impounded, and you will be required to pay a fine if stopped by the police.\nIt is against the law to use a mobile phone without a hands-free device while driving. There is a €300 fine for violating this regulation, and you may also lose your license.\nAll drivers and passengers are required to buckle up (even in taxis and in the backseat) and wear a reflective vest if they need to stop on the roadside. A reflective triangle warning sign is also mandatory if you stop on the roadside.\nYou must have liability insurance to operate any car or motorcycle.\nIf you are stopped by the Spanish National Police or the Guardia Civil, they may levy fines on the spot and issue a receipt for payment. This ensures that foreigners pay their fines while still in Spain.\nPublic Transportation:  Public transportation in large Spanish cities is generally excellent.\nOnly use clearly identified cabs, ensure that taxi drivers always switch on the meter (except for fixed-fare trips originating to and from the Madrid airport), and ask for a receipt.\nPrivate transportation companies (such as Uberor Cabify) are often used in Madrid and Barcelona but check private transportation websites for operating status before arrival.\nOfficial taxis to and from the Madrid airport to the city center charge a €30 flat rate.  Official taxis to and from the Barcelona airport to the cruise ship terminal charge a €39 flat rate.\nRail service is comfortable and reliable but varies in quality and speed. Intercity buses are usually comfortable and inexpensive.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Spain’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Spain’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page . \n \nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Spain should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the   U.S. Coast Guard homeport website  and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

The ETA system is available online or at the port of entry; however, visitors are strongly urged to use the online system to avoid lengthy delays at the port of entry. This travel authorization allows for a stay up to 30 days.\nU.S. citizens intending to visit Sri Lanka for short-term business activities such as participating in business meetings, engaging in business negotiations, or attending conferences and workshops are required to obtain a business ETA. Business ETAs can only be obtained from the nearest Sri Lankan Embassy or Consulate before arrival in Sri Lanka, or at the port of entry in Sri Lanka.\nU.S. citizens intending to visit Sri Lanka for religious or volunteer work or for local employment must obtain entry visas from the nearest Sri Lankan Embassy or Consulate before arrival in Sri Lanka. These visas are not available at the port of entry or through the online system.\nAll visitors staying beyond the expiration date of their visa must obtain an extension from the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo and pay the relevant visa fees or apply for an online  Visa Extension\nSpecific inquiries regarding entry and exit requirements should be addressed to:\nEmbassy of Sri Lanka \n3025 Whitehaven Street NW \nWashington DC 20008 \nTelephone: (202) 483-4025 \nFax: (202) 232- 2329 \nE-mail:  slemb.washington@mfa.gov.lk \nVisit the Sri Lanka  Ministry of Foreign Affairs Website  for current information.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions : The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Sri Lanka. \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack American citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets such as:\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism page .\nCrime:  Most crimes against U.S. citizens continue to be petty crime and crimes of opportunity (e.g., pickpocketing, hotel room thefts, and fraud). There is some organized criminal activity, which can involve drug-related crimes and gang-on-gang violence, but these events do not tend to involve foreign travelers.\nThere are occasional reports of credit card fraud. Authorities have arrested foreign nationals and organized groups for complicity in financial crimes. Avoid situations where your card is removed from your view. There have been reports of employees at reputable businesses (e.g., restaurants or chain grocery stores) wearing data skimming devices in their clothing and scanning a victim’s credit card or using other methods to steal credit card information. ATM skimming is also a threat. If you use an ATM, be on the lookout for skimming devices. Cover keypads with your hand.\nStreet hustlers are common around popular hotels, shopping areas, and other tourist sites. There are occasional reports of snatch-and-grab theft of purses or jewelry owned by tourists, but no recent reports of armed robberies. Beware of tuk-tuk or taxi drivers offering “special” tours or access to festivals or gem shops. This common scam often results in tourists being heavily pressured to buy “gems” that are either cut glass or are worth much less than the price being asked.\nBeware of scams involving tuk-tuk drivers. In a common scam, drivers charge for the ride using a third-party app on their phone, saying the meter is broken, and then charge a much higher amount than the normal cost. If a tuk-tuk does not have a meter, agree on a price before beginning the ride, and try to have the correct amount of cash so you do not need change. Ride apps are available in Sri Lanka for tuk-tuks and other vehicles.\nSurf schools are known to run scams where they claim renters damaged their boards and demand exorbitant prices to repair the damage. Examine and take pictures of your surfboard before taking it into the water.\nSexual harassment is pervasive. Both foreigners and locals, especially women, often report being catcalled and physically harassed in crowded places and on public transportation.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues. They may also occur on politically significant holidays and during international events. \nIn general, demonstrations in Sri Lanka are peaceful, resulting only in traffic congestion. However, some have ended in violence between the protestors and police or opposition groups. Demonstrations can involve confrontations with police, resulting in the use of water cannons and tear gas to disperse crowds. Large political rallies are common. These rallies are generally peaceful but can disrupt traffic.\nScams : Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Sri Lanka.  Review the Department of State’s  Protecting Yourself from Scams  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nScams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited text messages and WhatsApp messages. Common scams include:\nTips to avoid scammers:\nBe cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to tell your friends and family where you are, meet at a well-known public place, and do not eat or drink anything that seems suspicious. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Sexual assault victims may also contact the tourist police at 011-242-1451 or by email at  dir.tourist@police.gov.lk  or  dptd@srilanka.travel .\nReport crimes to the local police at 011-242-1451 and contact the U.S. Embassy at  ColomboACS@state.gov . Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on help for  U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is not well regulated. Safety inspections for equipment and facilities are rare. Dangerous areas/activities are not always labeled properly. Staff may not be trained or certified by the host government or recognized authorities. If you get injured, you will likely only find appropriate medical treatment in or near major cities. First responders cannot reach areas outside major cities to provide urgent medical care. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.\nAt police and military checkpoints, you may be detained if you do not have your passport with you. When arriving in Sri Lanka, ensure your luggage does not contain prohibited or restricted items, including e-cigarettes and other vaping instruments, weapons, ammunition, explosives, gold, narcotics, and pornography. In some places, it is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings.\nPenalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Sri Lanka are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Under the Cultural Prosperity Act and the Antiques Ordinance, the unlicensed export of antiques from the country is considered a criminal act.\nFurthermore, some crimes are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nSpecial Considerations : Sri Lanka recognizes limited  dual nationality . For further information, please contact the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington, the Consulate General in Los Angeles, or the Sri Lankan Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York.\nThe Sri Lankan police and military maintain several checkpoints throughout the country. U.S. citizens are advised to always carry identification such as their passports with them while in Sri Lanka. Photography is prohibited in designated high security zones and near many government facilities such as offices and military installations.\nReligious Laws:  Tourists should be mindful of restrictions and observances when planning to visit any religious establishment, whether Buddhist or Hindu temples, mosques, churches, or other locations considered sacred by the local population. Posing for a photograph with your back to a statue of Buddha is a serious offense in Sri Lanka, punishable by a fine or arrest. Travelers should be careful about showing religious images, like tattoos of Buddha, while in the country. Some foreign visitors have been arrested or not allowed to enter Sri Lanka because of these tattoos.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws.  Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety.  You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States.  See the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website  and  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details:\nInternational Volunteers:\nLGB Travelers : Same-sex sexual relationships and marriages are criminalized and carry maximum penalties of 10 years imprisonment and an unspecified fine.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information page  and  section 6 of our Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Sri Lanka prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, and the law is enforced. Even though there are rules about making buildings accessible, expect accessibility to be limited in most buildings. Potholes and sidewalks in poor repair can make movement very difficult. The road network in Sri Lanka is improving, but many roads remain in medium to poor condition. Sidewalks and road crossings in most major towns tend to be congested with vendors, stray dogs, and groups of people loitering on street corners. \nSee our  Travelers with Disabilities  page.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad page  and  FBI travel tips  for U.S. students.\nWomen Travelers:  If you find yourself in a life-threatening situation, you are encouraged to call the tourist police immediately at +92 011-242-1451, or email  dir.tourist@police.gov.lk  or  dptd@srilanka.travel , and follow up with a call to the Embassy at +92 011-202-8500. The Embassy may connect you with a non-governmental organization in Sri Lanka to provide additional assistance. \nSee our tips for  Women Travelers .\nFor emergency services in Sri Lanka, dial 1990.\nAmbulance services are widely available but training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards. They are not staffed with trained paramedics and often have little or no medical equipment. Injured or seriously ill travelers may prefer to take a taxi or private vehicle to the nearest major hospital rather than wait for an ambulance.\nSee our  Health Abroad page  for more information.\nCheck the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Traveler Advice for  Sri Lanka .\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance : Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  Insurance Overseas page  for more information on insurance providers with overseas coverage. Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Travel Insurance page  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. Check with  Sri Lanka's Ministry of Health  to ensure the medication is legal in Sri Lanka.\nVaccinations : Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recommended vaccines for the region include those against Japanese encephalitis, typhoid, and, for some travelers, rabies (pre-exposure prophylaxis).\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality : Visit  AirNow  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates and  ZephAir  for additional locations.\nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nHealth facilities in general:  There are six large hospitals in the Colombo area, including four facilities with emergency medical and trauma service:\nMedical facilities outside Colombo are limited. Hospitals and doctors often require payment “up front” prior to service or admission. Generally, government-run hospitals provide free healthcare services to any walk-in patient. The availability of medical supplies is inconsistent. Travelers should always carry necessary prescription medications with them. Serious medical conditions can require evacuation to the United States or to a nearby country with more advanced medical facilities.\nPharmaceuticals:  Exercise caution when purchasing medication overseas. Pharmaceuticals, which can be bought without a prescription or with a prescription in the United States, are usually easy to buy with few controls. Counterfeit medication is common and may not work, have the wrong strength, or have dangerous ingredients. You should buy medication with the help of a medical professional and from trusted places.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Food and Drug Administration have rules for bringing medication back to the United States. Medication bought abroad must meet their requirements to be legally brought back. The medication must be for personal use and approved for use in the United States. Visit the websites of  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and the  Food and Drug Administration  for more information.\nWater Quality & Food Safety:  In many areas, tap water is not potable. Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. You should be aware that many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless bottled water is specifically requested. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\nInfectious Diseases:  Several mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue fever, Chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are present in Sri Lanka. Dengue fever is widespread in Sri Lanka’s Western Province, where the capital Colombo is located. Adequate mosquito protection is strongly advised to prevent this serious illness.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions differ significantly from those in the United States. Vehicular traffic in Sri Lanka moves on the left (British style). Traffic in Colombo can be congested with narrow two-lane highways. Roads are often crowded with trucks, buses that are not driven well, and many other types of vehicles. You might see ox carts, bicycles, and newer four-wheel-drive cars all sharing the same road. Unexpected roadblocks and one-way streets are common and may not be clearly marked. Many visitors hire cars and drivers for longer trips. If you decide to hire a “tuk-tuk” or similar three-wheeled vehicle, make sure to use one with a meter or agree on the price before the ride. This will help you avoid problems when you reach your destination. If you are renting a vehicle, you should specifically request one with working seatbelts.\nHeavy rain sometimes causes flooding, which can make roads inaccessible for several days and increase the risk of landslides.\nGPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting you around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. The GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.\nPublic Transportation:  The Embassy does not recommend using public buses due to safety concerns.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of Sri Lanka’s  national tourist office  and national authority responsible for road safety.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed Sri Lanka’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with international standards for aviation safety oversight. FAA’s  website  includes more information on its assessment program.\nMaritime Travel:  U.S. citizens who arrive by yacht or private boat should be aware that all marine harbors are high security zones. Travelers arriving by sea should be prepared for Sri Lankan navy officials to inspect their vessels and should always wait for radio clearance before coming into port. \nMariners planning travel to Sri Lanka should also check for U.S. maritime  advisories  and  alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

Visit the  Embassy of the Republic of the Sudan  website for the most current visa information. Overseas inquiries should be made at the nearest Sudanese Embassy or consulate.\nThe Government of the Republic of the Sudan requires U.S. citizens to present a passport with at least six months validity and an entry visa or entry permit upon arrival at any port of entry in Sudan.\nU.S. citizens must obtain an entry visa from a Sudanese embassy before arriving in Sudan. There is one exception to this requirement: U.S. citizens possessing a Sudanese national identification document (such as a Sudanese passport, alien registration card, or national identification card).\nPrevious Travel to Israel:  Travelers with Israeli visas or exit/entry stamps are now permitted entry following a change in relations between Sudan and Israel in 2020.\nHIV/AIDS Restrictions:  Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors and foreign residents of Sudan. Sudanese law requires a negative HIV test result to obtain a work or residence visa. Please verify this information with the  Embassy of the Republic of the Sudan  before you travel. \nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Members and individual sympathizers of known terrorist groups and hardline political extremists could attack with little or no warning, targeting foreign and local government facilities and areas frequented by Westerners. Globally, terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:  \nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nViolence continues along the border between Chad and Sudan and areas near the border with South Sudan (including the disputed Abyei area). Armed opposition groups are active in Central Darfur state.\nLandmines and other explosive remnants of war still exist in rural areas; Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, Darfur, and the Eastern states, including along the Eritrean border, are the most affected. Border closures may occur without notice.\nIntercommunal and intracommunal clashes can occur throughout the country and can result in the declaration of localized states of emergency; civilians have been killed and government and security installations have been attacked.\nBlue Nile Region (Blue Nile, Sennar, and White Nile states) and Southern Kordofan Region (includes Abyei region, North Kordofan; South Kordofan; West Kordofan):  While violence has decreased significantly from previous years, tensions remain high. Banditry and intercommunal violence are common in these regions. Armed actors may transit the shared borders with South Sudan and Ethiopia.\nDarfur Region:  Flares of deadly intercommunal conflict continue, as does violence perpetrated by bandits and militias. Criminality, looting, and conflict over economic resources (land, gold, livestock) also is common. Tensions within camps for internally displaced people have resulted in fatalities and violence. Extrajudicial mobs and armed communal militia may mobilize quickly. Armed actors may transit Sudan’s shared borders with Chad and Central African Republic.\nEastern Sudan (Kassala, Gedaref, and Red Sea States):  Escalating tensions between Ethiopia and Sudan have prompted a sizeable build-up of military forces along the disputed border in Gedaref’s Fashaga region as well as recurring military-to-military engagements, clashes involving Ethiopian militias, and intercommunal reprisals over farmland. Incidents of cross-border criminality to include kidnapping have occurred. Human traffickers and organized crime syndicates are known to operate in the Kassala area (Kassala, Al Qadarif, and Red Sea states) along the Ethiopian and Eritrean borders. Stay on major roads if you are traveling by vehicle due to potential landmines and other explosive remnants of war.\nCrime:  Crime, such as kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion, and carjacking, can occur, though such crimes are more frequent outside of Khartoum. In   Khartoum, home invasion, pickpocketing, purse snatching, theft from vehicles, and other petty crime occur, and the number of petty crimes has increased over the past year. There is a risk of kidnapping. Expatriates are not generally targeted for crime in Khartoum, but may be caught in a ‘wrong place, wrong time’ situation.\nElsewhere in Sudan, particularly in Darfur, armed robbery, kidnapping, carjacking, and looting is common; victims may be targeted based on perceived wealth or affiliation, and aid workers continue to be affected by such crimes. Banditry is prevalent throughout western Sudan, particularly in the Darfur and Chad–Sudan border regions, where several incidents have resulted in deaths. Sexual assault is widespread in areas of armed conflict.\nDemonstrations:  Small gatherings and demonstrations can occur with no warning and may escalate to violence. Protests are a regular occurrence since the 2019 revolution, with the pace increasing following the October 25, 2021 military takeover. Police and other security forces may intervene to disperse demonstrators, including with the use of tear gas and, in some instances, live ammunition, when protests occur near key governmental locations and/or impair freedom of movement. Protests and demonstrations have led to extended disruptions to telecommunications and, in some instances, airport closures, inhibiting U.S. citizens’ abilities to communicate with friends and family or depart the country. Historical anniversaries, calls for justice, and economic grievances, including bread, cooking oil, and fuel shortages, can precipitate demonstrations.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault or domestic violence are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +249 18 702 2000. Dial 777 to contact the police for traffic emergencies, 998 for fire, and 333 for medical emergencies. Emergency services and the telephone network are unreliable. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance. \nTourism:  Little to no formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is often limited or inadequate. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Convictions for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs can result in long jail sentences and heavy fines. While the consumption of alcohol is no longer prohibited for non-Muslims, regulations and enforcement remain unclear. You may be detained for questioning by the police if unable to produce an acceptable form of identification. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website. \n \nTravel Permits:  A permit, obtainable from the Ministry of Tourism by your hotel or travel agent, is required for travel outside of the greater Khartoum area. A copy of the permit will be sent to the Aliens Department at the Ministry of Interior. A separate travel permit is required for travel to Darfur. The Embassy’s ability to provide consular services outside of Khartoum, including emergency assistance, is severely limited. Carry multiple copies of permits, as travelers without permits may be detained and arrested.\nPhotography:  Do not take photographs of any areas which may be sensitive to the government, including police and military installations, camps for internally displaced persons, and border areas. Photography requires a permit from the External Information Centre in Khartoum (part of the Ministry of Information). Even with a permit, it is illegal to take pictures of military installations, public utilities, infrastructure (e.g., bridges, airports), slum areas, or beggars. Do not take photographs or use equipment with cameras (including cell phone camera and laptops) close to government buildings. You could be fined, have your photographic equipment confiscated without notice, and risk detention and arrest. Do not take photos of Sudanese without their permission.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nThe U.S. Embassy will not receive notification of your arrest. Moreover, dual U.S.-Sudanese nationals will be prosecuted as Sudanese citizens, impeding our ability to provide consular services.\nSharia Law/Customs:  Personal status laws govern legal procedures pertaining to family relations, including marriage, divorce, child custody, maintenance (financial support), and inheritance. We strongly advise you seek local legal counsel if you must engage in local legal matters and make certain you are aware of your rights and responsibilities. Some national laws reflect a sharia system of jurisprudence. Non-Muslims are sometimes convicted of offenses based on officials’ interpretation of Islamic law. The government enacted legislation in July 2020 that removed flogging as a punishment for criminal and civil crimes. However, flogging remains a common sentence for hudud, which are punishments mandated under Islamic law for serious offenses. Non-Muslim women are not expected to wear a veil or cover their heads. Both women and men should dress modestly. Shorts are not appropriate. Public displays of affection are discouraged. Pornography is not permitted. Government offices and businesses follow an Islamic workweek (Sunday to Thursday).\nPhone Service:  Cellular phones are common, as other telephone service is unreliable and landlines are nearly non-existent. It may be possible to purchase a SIM card locally and use a U.S.-compatible cell phone. Check for compatibility with local cellular networks with your phone carrier or manufacturer before you go. During periods of civil unrest, Sudanese authorities may cut all telecommunications for extended periods of time. Maintain alternate means of communication in such an event.\nCurrency:  The Sudanese pound (SDG) is the official currency. Sudan operates on a cash-only economy; U.S.-issued credit and debit cards do not work. Carry sufficient funds in U.S. dollars to cover all your expenses for the duration of your stay. Bills must be printed after 2006 and unblemished. Do not carry a large amount of cash because travelers carrying large amounts of U.S. currency have been detained and currency confiscated. Sudan has no international ATMs. Local ATMs draw on local banks only. Western Union operates in Khartoum only. Exchange currency only at reputable banks. Exchanging currency outside of official banking channels is illegal and is punishable by imprisonment and fines.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  Sudanese law does not specifically prohibit homosexuality but criminalizes sodomy, which is punishable if convicted by five years in jail for an initial offense. Sudan’s civilian-led transitional government abolished corporal and capital punishment for conviction of sodomy. LGB persons are not considered a protected class under antidiscrimination laws. Anti–LGB sentiment remains pervasive in society. LGB organizations have alleged being pressured to alter their activities due to threat of harm. There have been no reports of official action to investigate or punish those complicit in LGB related discrimination or abuses.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section six of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Access to transportation, lodging, and public buildings is limited for people with mobility issues. There are few sidewalks and no curb-cuts, and most buildings lack functioning elevators.\nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  Early and forced marriage of children continues. While Sudan has criminalized Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), the national prevalence rate of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting is 88 percent. Spousal abuse is common. Women who file claims of domestic violence are subjected to accusations of spreading false information, harassment, and detention. Police normally do not intervene in domestic disputes. Rape is a serious problem throughout the country, especially in conflict areas. See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nConsult the  CDC website for Sudan  prior to travel.\nMedical facilities in Khartoum are adequate for routine care, but the hospitals are not suitable for more serious medical problems. Outside the capital, few facilities exist, hospitals and clinics are poorly equipped, and ambulance services are unavailable. Medicines are available only intermittently. Emergency medical treatment is provided for 24 hours before payment is required. For all other care, providers expect payment in Sudanese pounds in full before treatment is performed.\nFor emergency services in Sudan, dial 333.\nAmbulance services are: \nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance. \nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. \nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation. \nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription and bring enough medication for the duration of your trip. Check with Sudanese customs to ensure the medication is legal in Sudan. \nVaccinations:  Be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe following diseases are prevalent :\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. \nThe U.S. Embassy maintains a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \n \nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Road conditions are poor and traffic accidents common. Driving is hazardous due to excessive speeds, erratic driver behavior, pedestrians, animals in the roadways, and vehicles that are overloaded or lack basic safety equipment. Only major highways and some streets in the cities are paved; others are narrow and rutted. While there are functioning traffic signals and streetlights on major thoroughfares in Khartoum, there are virtually none in other parts of the country.\nA four-wheel-drive vehicle is strongly recommended due to variance in road conditions on major inter-city highways. South of Khartoum, road conditions deteriorate significantly during the rainy season from June to October and dust storms (“haboobs”) greatly reduce visibility. Travel outside of Khartoum should be undertaken with a minimum of two vehicles to protect against the threat of criminal attacks. Use reliable GPS and carry additional fuel, spare tires, and provisions. Professional roadside assistance service is not available, and gas shortages are common.\nLandmines:  Exercise caution in remote areas or off main roads outside of Khartoum due to landmines. Landmines are most common in the Eastern states and Southern Kordofan. Stay on main roads marked as cleared by a competent de-mining authority.\nTraffic Laws:  An international driving permit or Sudanese license and third-party liability insurance from the government is required. You may use a U.S. driver's license for up to 90 days. You can get a local driving license from the police traffic department. It is illegal to use a cell phone while driving. Comprehensive insurance is recommended because many local drivers carry no insurance.\nAccidents:  In the event of an automobile accident, remain inside the vehicle and wait for police. If a hostile mob forms or you feel your safety is in danger, leave the scene, and proceed directly to the nearest police station. Do not stop at the scene of an accident or at intersections where people have gathered, as mobs can develop quickly.\nPublic Transportation:  Avoid travel by public transportation and hire private transport from a reliable source. Your company’s in-country staff, travel agencies, and local hotels may be able to arrange private transport on your behalf. Any form of public transportation is unregulated, unreliable, and generally unsafe. Service is basic and crowded. Schedules are unpublished and change without notice. While there is some public transit to rural communities by irregularly scheduled mini-buses, many areas lack any public transportation.\nBuses:  Fatal accidents are routine. Many drivers have little training and are reckless, and the vehicles are often poorly maintained. Most buses and bus stops are privately operated and unmarked.\nTaxis:  Taxis are available throughout Khartoum; however, most do not meet U.S. safety standards. Drivers rarely speak English. Have your destination written down in Arabic.\nTrains:  There is weekly passenger train service from Khartoum to Wadi Halfa and to Port Sudan. Trains are dilapidated.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information\nAviation Safety Oversight:   As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Sudan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Sudan should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the   U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings .

Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nSweden has been subject to terrorist incidents in the past and the potential for a future terrorist incident remains.  As in other countries in the Schengen area, Sweden’s open borders with its European neighbors could permit terrorist groups to enter and exit the country with anonymity. European governments are taking action to guard against terrorist attacks, but all European countries remain potentially vulnerable to attacks from transnational terrorist organizations.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism page .\nCrime:  Sweden has a low crime rate, and most crimes involve the theft of personal property from vehicles, residences, and public areas. While armed violence against the public continues to be a rare occurrence, violent crimes, such as homicides and sexual assaults, can occur. The majority of violent crimes occur in Sweden’s larger cities, such as Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmo. Organized crime groups have also committed armed acts against each other.\nPickpocketing and petty theft are common in and around major tourist attractions, especially Stockholm’s Old Town (“Gamla Stan”) as well as at restaurants, coffee shops, amusement parks, museums, bars, airports, and on public transportation.\nHotel breakfast rooms and lobbies attract well-dressed, professional thieves who blend in with guests and target purses and briefcases left unguarded by tourists and business travelers.\nDo not buy counterfeit or pirated goods, even if they are widely available. Not only are counterfeit goods illegal to bring back into the United States, but if you purchase them, you may also be breaking local law.\nDemonstrations  occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\nInternational Financial Scams : See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Sweden.

If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.

The maximum legal blood-alcohol level is .02% - much lower than in the United States. Swedish police often conduct alcohol tests on roads and highways. Drunk driving rules are strictly enforced and fines can be severe, including possible jail sentences.\nChild Protection Laws:  The treatment of children is taken very seriously in Sweden. All forms of corporal punishment of children are against the law, and any form of violence, humiliating treatment, or neglect may result in the child being taken away from parents by the Swedish authorities and placed into long-term care by Sweden’s social services and/or criminal charges being brought against the offending parent. Homeschooling is not allowed in Sweden, except under extraordinary circumstances.\nCompulsory Military Service:  In March 2017, Sweden reintroduced military conscription for men and women. Dual U.S.-Swedish citizens are also subject to conscription, although persons who have previously done military service may be excluded from the requirement and should contact the Swedish Ministry of Defense for more information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws.

Visas are issued for a period of 90 days and are valid for stays up to 60 days. The e-Visa is non-extendable and you can  apply for it  only if you are outside of Tajikistan. Registration with the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) is not required when admitted using an e-Visa.\nRefer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)’s Main Consular Department’s  website  for further visa information.\nNon-tourist visas:  Applications for non-tourist purposes of travel, including to visit family or friends (XC1-visa), to conduct business (K-visa), or to attend an educational facility (O-visa), can be submitted online to the MFA’s Main Consular Department. Supporting documents, including a Tajik visa support letter, are required. Visa validities and fees vary depending on purpose of travel. A personal appearance at a Tajik embassy or consulate may be required depending on the visa category.\nTajik visa support letters are required for all non-tourist visas. To obtain a visa support letter, the inviting organization submits a request to the MFA’s Main Consular Department. When invited by a private Tajik resident (e.g., a friend or relative), the inviting party requests a notification letter from the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR). Any required supporting documents and the visa support letter should be submitted to the MFA’s Main Consular Department in Tajikistan by the inviting party.\nSome non-tourist visa categories allow for the visa to be issued upon arrival, eliminating the need to appear in-person at a Tajik embassy or consulate. This upon-arrival request must be selected at the time the application is submitted online and an additional fee will be required.\nTajik visa registration stamps are required for non-tourist stays more than two days. Most travelers must register within three days of entering the country at the nearest Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR).

If you arrive in Russia without the appropriate visa, authorities may restrict you from future travel to Russia. Refer to information on  Travel.State.Gov for visa requirements for Russia .\nDual Nationality:  Tajikistan does not recognize dual nationality with the United States. If you are a dual national of the United States and Tajikistan, or otherwise have ethnic or historical ties to Tajikistan, it is possible that Tajik authorities will assert that you are a Tajik citizen, and if you are detained, may deny you access to U.S. consular officials.\nIf you are a naturalized U.S. citizen or have a possible claim to Tajik nationality, and you are traveling to Tajikistan, inform yourself about Tajik nationality law and practices relating to determination and loss of Tajik citizenship. Under Tajik law, naturalization as a U.S. citizen does not automatically cancel your Tajik nationality. If you have questions about your Tajik nationality, please contact the  Embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan  in the United States of America.\nU.S. citizens, including U.S. citizen minor children, who are planning to remain in Tajikistan for an extended period of time, are required to have a valid Tajik visa.

Their activities mostly include recruiting sympathizers and followers through online platforms and social media, with the aim of conducting terrorist attacks in Tajikistan and other countries. While attacks are rare in Tajikistan, terrorists have planned and carried out attacks against foreigners and government entities, such as law enforcement and security services.\nTajik authorities maintain a high level of security to thwart terrorist attacks. This could lead terrorists to seek softer targets including facilities where U.S. citizens and other foreigners congregate such as residential areas; clubs and restaurants; markets; places of worship; schools; hotels; outdoor recreational events, including popular hiking areas; and resorts. U.S. citizens should avoid predictable patterns of movement and revealing their personal information and location on social media. If using social media, ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set.\nU.S. Embassy Dushanbe employs heightened security precautions. U.S. citizens should report any unusual activity to local authorities and then inform the Embassy.\nBorder Areas with Afghanistan:  Reconsider travel near and along Tajikistan’s border with Afghanistan due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Additionally, the land border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan has been closed since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border. Militant groups have attempted cross-border rocket attacks and armed incursions into Tajikistan. Be vigilant when camping, biking, or sheltering in the open after dark. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting travel on social media, please ensure your privacy settings are appropriately set.\nRestricted Zone of Gorno-Badakhshan:  Reconsider travel to Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO). The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable environment in the border areas due to evolving security conditions. Do not enter the Gorno-Badakhshan (GBAO) region without official permission. Persons violating the law may be detained by Tajik law enforcement. Violent clashes with security forces erupted in GBAO in recent years, and the government of Tajikistan can suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice. To enter this restricted zone, request a special permit from Tajik embassies/consulates or from the MFA’s Main Consular Department or the Department of Visas and Registration of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (OVIR) if applying within Tajikistan. Submit authorization requests at least two weeks in advance of your trip. If granted, authorities will annotate your passport with the names of the settlements and cities you are authorized to visit.\nIf applying for an e-Visa for tourism, you can apply for official permission to visit GBAO at the same time, for an additional fee. Please visit the  Republic of Tajikistan’s e-visa application webpage  for information on electronic visas to Tajikistan and instructions for a GBAO permit.\nBorder Areas with Kyrgyzstan:  Exercise caution in areas near and along Tajikistan’s border with Kyrgyzstan.   Several instances of clashes between Tajik and Kyrgyz citizens, as well as armed skirmishes involving border guards, have occurred, particularly in the Isfara and Vorukh districts.\nUnexploded Landmines  and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys. Heed land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked off with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails.

Sexual harassment of unaccompanied women is very common. Carry a copy of your passport (separate from your wallet) with you at all times.\nSee the  Department of State  and the  FBI webpages  for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of crime, including sexual assault and domestic violence, may wish to contact the police or head to the nearest hospital to seek medical attention and report the crime. Please also contact the U.S. Embassy at (992)-37-229-2000.\nThe local equivalent to the 911 emergency line in Tajikistan is 101 for fire, 102 for police, and 103 for ambulance service (from cell phones), and in Dushanbe, dial 235-4545 for the State Traffic Inspectorate (GAI) police for traffic accidents.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nTourism:  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in most locations.

Armed police or military checkpoints can make road travel outside Dushanbe more difficult.\nWinter Road Travel:   Please exercise caution and limit winter travel to Tajikistan’s mountain regions. Avalanches are common. Don’t attempt to travel over closed mountain passes. Roads are often not well maintained. For Dushanbe-Chanak (Dushanbe-Khujand) road conditions, please contact  Innovative Road Solutions (IRS).\nLand Mines :  Land mines and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys.

Several small-scale bombings occurred near some tourist locations in the far Southern provinces in August 2016 and December 2018. In August 2015, an explosion near the Erawan Shrine in downtown Bangkok killed at least 20 people and injured more than 100. The U.S. Department of State assesses there is a continued risk of terrorism in Southeast Asia, including in Thailand.\nIf a protest or demonstration is expected to pass near the U.S. Embassy or Consulate facilities,  Embassy and Consulate entrances and functions may be restricted. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok’s  website ,  Facebook,  and  Twitter  sites and the U.S. Consulate General in Chiang Mai’s  website ,  Facebook , and  Twitter  sites post information about local events that may affect Embassy functions. Enroll in the  Smart Traveler Enrollment Program  ( STEP ) to receive security and safety messages.\nFar Southern Thailand:  Periodic violence directed mostly at Thai government interests by a domestic insurgency continues to affect security in the southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, and Songkhla. U.S. citizens are at risk of death or injury due to the possibility of indiscriminate attacks in public places. Martial law is in force in this region.\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces. Travel to this region by U.S government employees must be reviewed and approved in advance.

Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities.

U.S. citizen detainees often complain of stark, austere living conditions, overcrowding, and unhealthy conditions. Personal security is poor. In addition, the main IDC in Bangkok does not dependably provide adequate medical or mental health care. In 2019, two U.S. citizens died while in custody at the Bangkok IDC. Deportations are self-funded and it may take up to two weeks for Thai authorities to process a case before deportation. Detainees must have funds to purchase a phone card and do not have access to the internet. Prior approval and a security escort are required to visit a Western Union or an ATM machine.\nLèse majesté (Royal Insult):  Thais hold the monarchy in the highest regard.

The U.S. Embassy will not intervene in private contract or family law disputes in Togo, and you must seek the recourse of the Togolese judicial system, even if you are a U.S. citizen.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification : If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information. The Government of Togo may refuse to recognize the U.S. citizenship of dual national Togolese citizens arrested in Togo.   \nFaith-Based Travelers : See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers : Local law forbids “acts against nature committed with an individual of one’s sex,” widely understood to mean same-sex sexual activity. If you are convicted of engaging in consensual same-sex sexual activity, you may be imprisoned and/or fined. However, the U.S. Embassy has not witnessed Togolese prosecutions against U.S. citizens for same-sex activity to date. \nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance : The Togolese government does not mandate accessibility to public or private facilities for persons with disabilities, although some buildings may have ramps and wider entrance ways.\nStudents : See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers : Women travelling alone are encouraged to take similar precautions as they would in any large U.S. city while in the country. Travel in groups and be extra vigilant after dark, particularly in the beach and central market areas of Lomé.\nSee our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nTogo no longer requires documentation related to COVID-19 (such as proof of vaccination, negative PCR test, or antigen test when entering or exiting Togo.\nHowever, it is recommended to passengers, when leaving Togo, to verify the current COVID-19 requirements in their destination country to ensure compliance.\nTravelers aged 12 and up are encouraged to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and to observe health precautions.\nMedical facilities and services in Togo are severely limited, including in the major cities of Lomé and Kara. The standard of care, including basic medical services, such as imaging or blood tests, is much lower than that of the United States and even neighboring Ghana. If you have a recurring or limiting medical condition that requires regular consultation or treatment by a medical professional, you should not travel to Togo.\nYou should carry adequate supplies of any needed prescription medicines, along with copies of your prescriptions, the generic name of the drugs, and a supply of preferred over-the-counter medications. You may encounter shortages of routine medications, and supplies and counterfeit medications are a frequent problem.\nRefer to the CDC website for  health information for travelers to Togo .\nFor emergency services in Togo, dial:\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.  Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance :  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nAlways carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. The Togolese government does not maintain a website with prohibited medications, but usually if the medication is legal in France, it is legal in Togo.\nVaccinations :  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther Health Information :\nHealth Facilities in General :\nPharmaceuticals :\nNon-Traditional Medicine :\nWater Quality :\nAdventure Travel :\nGeneral Health :\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nAir Quality :  Visit  Air Now Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. embassies and consulates.\nThe air quality in Togo varies considerably and fluctuates with the seasons.  During the annual harmattan season, when winds blow dust in from the Sahel, followed by a subsequent burn season, when farmers routinely burn their fields, air quality can reach hazardous levels in Togo (Dec- Feb).  Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.\nPeople at the greatest risk from particle pollution exposure include:\nCurrent air quality data can be found on the  Embassy’s Air Quality page . The data on this site are updated hourly.\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgey :\nRoad Conditions and Safety :  While some major thoroughfares in urban parts of Togo are paved, most secondary streets are not. Streets, especially in Lomé, can become flooded and impassable when it rains. Driving conditions are hazardous throughout Togo due to aggressive and poorly trained drivers who are not licensed and often carry loads in excess of their vehicle’s capacity. The presence of pedestrians, bicyclists, animals on the road, swarms of motorcycles, gaping sewer holes, and deteriorating pavement make driving both inside Lomé and outside particularly hazardous. Overland travel off the main north-south road connecting Lomé to Ouagadougou and east-west road connecting Lomé to Accra and Cotonou are usually unpaved and may require four-wheel drive. Togo also has a mountainous region abutting Ghana with roads that can rise up to an altitude of 500 meters within a few kilometers of driving.\nNighttime travel in Togo is especially dangerous and never recommended, particularly on the main north-south and east-west roads that see heavy semi-truck traffic from neighboring countries day and night. Even when driving in the city, keep car doors locked and the windows up. You should be aware of your surroundings and drive defensively. If you are involved in an accident, do not get out of the car if the vehicle is still drivable; instead, drive to the nearest gendarme or police precinct to report the accident. Tell other individuals involved where you are going so that they may follow. Do not attempt to negotiate the issue of damages or fault on the street without a Togo traffic officer or gendarme present.\nTraffic Laws :  Many drivers in Togo do not obey traffic laws, which are rarely enforced. Traffic signals often do not function properly or are missing from major intersections. If you choose to drive in Togo, you should observe someone else drive beforehand in order to familiarize yourself with atypical driving practices, including stopping prior to entering a traffic circle.  You should be prepared for drivers who run red lights and stop signs or drive in the wrong direction on one-way streets. Driving can be chaotic, particularly in the crowded city center and in the dense neighborhoods along the Ghanaian border.\nAt official checkpoints, Togolese security officials prefer that you approach with your interior light on, headlights dimmed, and have your driver’s license, registration, and proof of insurance ready. You should carry copies of important documents, such as your passport and driver’s license, to provide to authorities rather than handing over your originals. You should never pay a bribe to the police or gendarmes for them to perform their work or to be released. Be firm and polite, and ask for permission to drive with the officer who is making the traffic stop, or trail their vehicle or motorbike, to the nearest police precinct if a resolution cannot be reached on the street. Do not let the officer enter your vehicle.\nPublic Transportation :  Safety standards for small, private buses and taxis are substandard. You should exercise caution when using any form of local public transportation, and avoid motorcycle-taxis when possible. Never get into a taxi with unknown passengers, and always agree on the fare before getting into the car.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight :  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Togo, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Togo’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nMaritime Travel :  Mariners planning travel to Togo should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  NGA broadcast warnings ."

The cost of the test is $31.   \nTurkmenistan’s Law on Citizenship does not allow its citizens to have dual citizenship. As a result, the country often stops U.S.-Turkmen dual citizens from leaving until they give up their Turkmen citizenship. This process can take several months. The ability of the U.S. Embassy in Ashgabat to assist such dual citizens is very limited. We strongly urge all dual U.S.-Turkmen citizens to contact the Embassy for more information before traveling to Turkmenistan. \nPlease see the   Embassy's page on dual citizenship  for additional information. \nA letter of invitation is required for entry into Turkmenistan. The person or organization inviting you must submit a request to the   State Migration Service (SMS)  along with a copy of your passport ID page. After receiving the letter of invitation, apply for a visa at the Embassy of Turkmenistan in Washington, D.C. or at the airport in Ashgabat upon arrival. The cost of the visa application varies depending on the length of validity. A $29 registration fee is also required upon arrival. \nWe cannot help private citizens obtain letters of invitation. \nIf you arrive without a visa or certified letter of invitation, officials may hold you at the airport. They will keep you until you arrange a way out of Turkmenistan. \nRegister yourself and apply for visa extensions with the SMS in Ashgabat. You must register with SMS within 3 working days of your arrival. You must do this if you plan to stay in Turkmenistan more than 3 working days.

Restricted zones include border areas and along the Caspian coast. \nFailure to register properly or to update your visa with SMS can result in fines, arrest, and/or deportation. Visit a local SMS office to learn about additional requirements. \nIf you are deported for these violations, authorities will bar your return to Turkmenistan for up to five years. \nHIV/AIDS Information:  Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors to and foreign residents of Turkmenistan. Foreign workers may be required to undergo HIV testing for business visas. Please verify this information with the  Embassy of Turkmenistan  before you travel. \nFind information on   dual nationality,  the prevention of  international child abduction , and   customs regulations  on  Travel.State.gov .  \nCrime:   Crime is limited. There are few reports of violent crime in Turkmenistan. Take normal safety precautions, such as avoiding travel after dark or in deserted/unfamiliar areas.\nProstitution is illegal. The definition of a prostitute is subjective. Police are known to raid local establishments for prostitution. \nPolice and military are present in all regions of Turkmenistan. Security personnel maintain checkpoints on major roads and may place visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, e-mail, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. \nAlways carry your passport; otherwise, you may be detained. Police asking to see identity papers can be aggressive and have been known to solicit bribes. Ask for identification if you are unsure the person requesting to see your documents is an official. \nInternational Financial Scams: See the   Department of State  and the   FBI  pages for information. \nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at 02 and  contact the U.S. Embassy  at the following numbers:\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime. \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . \nWe can: \nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to  contact the Embassy  for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response capabilities are limited, or unreliable, and urgent medical treatment can be inappropriate or not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on   insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.\nIndividuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. \nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad. Also, see the  Department of Justice website.\nIt is illegal to take pictures of certain buildings. Ask before taking pictures of anything of possible military or security interest, including government buildings and food markets. \nIf you stay overnight in a location other than the one where you are registered with the SMS, you may be arrested.\nLocal law criminalizes the knowing exposure or transmission of HIV to another person and carries a sentence of up to 5 years. The law also stipulates sentences of up to 20 years for the spread of HIV or other sexually transmitted infections through same-sex contact. \nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to  notify the U.S. Embassy immediately . See our  webpage  for further information.\nMoney:  Turkmenistan has a cash economy. Most businesses, including airlines and hotels, do not accept credit cards. While there are some ATMs in Ashgabat, getting personal checks cashed can take up to two months. \nThe official currency in Turkmenistan is the Turkmen Manat. It is illegal to use foreign currencies and to exchange money on the black market. You can obtain Manat in ATM machines. \nCustoms rules are strict. This is especially true for carpets, jewelry, music instruments, art, ancient artifacts, antiques, and protected animals. Before purchasing such items for export, see the  Embassy of Turkmenistan website  for their customs information. \nFaith-Based Travelers:  See our following webpages for details: \nLGB Travelers:  Sexual contact between men is illegal and carries criminal penalties.

Bottled water and drinks are safe. Many restaurants and hotels serve tap water unless you ask for bottled. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.  \nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic accidents involving serious injury to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians are common. Many city roads are hazardous because of potholes, uncovered manholes, poor lighting, and pedestrians ignoring oncoming traffic. Most roads outside of major cities are narrow, not lighted, and lacking road signs. Avoid driving at night on rural roads. \nDrive defensively and use an abundance of caution. Driving practices differ from those in the United States, and can include drivers going down the wrong way on one-way streets or divided highways, sudden lane changes, left-hand turns from the right lane, etc. \nThere is no roadside assistance in Turkmenistan. \nTraffic Laws:  If you drive while intoxicated, you may be fined, imprisoned, and have your license revoked. You may be fined if you don’t use seat belts or if you drive while using a cell phone.

When traveling at night, hire a driver through your travel agency or hotel. \nThe only government-owned/government-regulated taxi company operates in Ashgabat (telephone 993-12-760501) \nTravel by Ferry:  “Ferries” crossing the Caspian Sea are cargo ships that also take on passengers as space permits. Food and water are not typically provided, and sleeping and sanitary facilities are basic. Ships arriving in Turkmenbashy may take a week to find a vacant dock. \nAirlines:  Regular international commercial flights have resumed, but demand for available seats remains high. Tickets for Turkmenistan Airlines flights may only be purchased in-person in Turkmenistan. Travelers should also note that delayed flight times are common when entering or exiting Turkmenistan. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Turkmenistan, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Turkmenistan’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

The U.S. citizen was later released unharmed. \nThere is increased terrorist activity within the region. Recent events include the Ugandan Police Force reportedly foiling a planned bomb attack on churches by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebel group about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Kampala; reported foiled plots of church attacks and subsequent explosive devices found in Kampala, and a fatal terror attack by ISIS-CA killing two international tourists and Ugandan driver within Queen Elizabeth National Park. Anyone can be a victim at any time; U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid large public gatherings. Communications plans are basic ways for people to ensure they can be reached while on travel or anywhere really. This includes having different types of communications (email, phone, satellite phone), letting people know when one will be in an area of cell coverage to receive messages, and providing phone numbers of the locations one will be staying etc. The State Department discusses this in the link here:  https://exchanges.state.gov/us/keeping-touch .\nNorthern and Eastern Uganda : The South Sudan-Uganda border is porous, and there are frequent reports of criminal trade and movement of people across the border. Due to the influx of refugees from South Sudan into Uganda, there is a strain on the region’s health, education, and security resources. Sporadic clashes may occur along the shared border, which may be poorly demarcated; a section is under dispute in the Moyo area of northwestern Uganda, abutting the Kajo Keji area of South Sudan.\nCrime and conflict threat in the Karamoja region in northeastern Uganda remain volatile. The Uganda People’s Defense Force actively engages criminals in the Karamoja Region, and armed confrontation between police and criminal elements can occur. Emergency medical care and auto repair services are lacking in remote areas of the Karamoja Region. The U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the Karamoja region.\nSouthwestern Uganda/Western Uganda : U.S. citizens traveling in southwestern Uganda along Uganda’s western border with the DRC should be aware that armed groups, including those aligned with terrorist organizations such as ISIS-CA, are active in eastern DRC, along with ongoing military operations to counter the threat in the region. Travelers should review the  country information page and Travel Advisory  for the DRC. Refugee flows across the border can number in the thousands, and there is a risk of incursions by armed combatants and criminals.\nThere is a potential for violence related to ethnic and tribal tensions in the western districts of Bundibuguyo, Ntoroko, and Kasese, near the border with the DRC. U.S. citizens should be vigilant and monitor local media for the latest news.\nThere is an uptick in terrorist activity in this specific region. Attacks in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Kasese,and Mpondwe-Lhubiriha have resulted in deaths of Ugandan as well as foreign nationals.\nThe Governments of Rwanda and Uganda closed the Rwanda-Uganda border for extended periods of time in the last year. Some shutdowns are 24-hour closures and others are only overnight closures. Travelers should ensure the border is open when attempting to travel between Rwanda and Uganda.\nThe U.S. Embassy requires its employees to follow enhanced protocols when traversing the region from Lake Albert down to the Rwandan border.\nThe U.S. State Department encourages overseas travelers to develop communication plans to ensure they can be reached while traveling. This includes having different types of communications (email, phone, satellite phone), letting people know when one will be in an area of cell coverage to receive messages, and providing phone numbers of the locations one will be staying etc.\nDemonstrations : Demonstrations in Kampala and other cities periodically occur in response to local political developments Police routinely use tear gas – and sometimes live ammunition resulting in deaths – to disperse protests in urban areas. U.S. citizens are urged to monitor media coverage of local events and be aware of their surroundings at all times. Avoid demonstrations, as even peaceful gatherings can turn violent without notice.\nInvolvement in Local Social Issues : All U.S. citizen travelers to Uganda should ensure that they have the correct visa for their visit to Uganda. Missionary and NGO work frequently require a work visa. Travelers who plan to engage in religious or civil society activities should obtain the appropriate visa from the Embassy of Uganda before departing the United States. The Government of Uganda has shown an increased interest in the activities of foreigners working with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Local authorities have been known to detain, question, and arrest foreigners in Uganda, and some visitors have been ordered removed from the country.\nCrime : Pick pocketing, purse snatching, and thefts from hotel rooms, parked vehicles, and vehicles stalled in traffic jams are common. Armed robberies of pedestrians and car jackings also occur, sometimes during daylight hours and in public places. Victims usually remain unharmed if they do not resist. Assaults and property snatching by boda boda (motorcycle operators and passengers) are routinely reported. \n \nFood and drinks should never be left unattended in public. Women have reported being drugged and taken to another location and sexually assaulted. Similar tactics are used to rob individuals on public transportation. Remain with a group of friends in public, as single individuals are more likely to be targeted.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Uganda. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:\nVictims of Crime : Victims of sexual assault should seek medical assistance and counseling immediately regarding prophylactic treatment to help prevent the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. A  list of local medical providers  can be found on the U.S. Embassy website.\nReport crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (256) (0) 414-306-001.\nRemember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting the crime.\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance.\nReport crimes to the local police at 999 and contact the U.S. Embassy at +(256)(0) 414-306-001.

ATMs are available, but many only function for customers who have an account with a specific Ugandan bank.\nCharities/NGOs : U.S. citizens planning to work for or donate money to an NGO should have the charity provide references of past volunteers whom they may contact. U.S. citizens have reported intimidation and harassment by directors of organizations when questioned about the organization's activities or use of donated funds.\nInformation about registering an NGO can be obtained from the Ugandan NGO Bureau, which has offices within the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They can be reached at (256) (0) 414 253 446. If a Certificate of Good Conduct/Criminal Background Check is needed to start or work for an NGO, you can obtain it by contacting your local police or on  the FBI website  before traveling.\nFaith-Based Travelers : See our following webpages for details:\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance : Accessibility to public transportation may be difficult for those with mobility issues. Foot paths and road crossings present barriers. There are no free or reduced taxi fares, or other accommodations in communication, lodging, medical facilities, restaurants, cafes, bars, or other tourist spots for disabled tourists.\nStudents : See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers : See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nLGB Travelers:  The May 2023 Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA) includes penalties up to life imprisonment for consensual same-sex relations and capital punishment for crimes of “aggravated homosexuality” (such as serial offenders). Youth under the age of 18 could be prosecuted and imprisoned for multi-year sentences. LGB persons, including youth, may be subject to forced conversion therapy. LGB persons, or persons perceived to be LGB, could face harassment, imprisonment, blackmail, and violence, with heightened risk surrounding the passage of the AHA; The public is required to report to the police a person suspected of committing or intending to commit acts enumerated in the law. Hoteliers are not permitted to knowingly provide rooms to individuals who may commit acts deemed illegal in the AHA. Individuals or organizations viewed as publicly supporting the dignity and human rights of LGB persons could be prosecuted and imprisoned for multi-year sentence, including those that attend a same-sex marriage either inside or outside of Uganda’s borders. LGB organizations or those that advocate for the human rights of LGB persons may be deemed illegal under the law.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our Human Rights Report for further details. \n \n Importation of Healthcare Products : Individuals and organizations seeking to bring or import healthcare products, including medicines and medical devices, are responsible for ensuring the importation is in accordance with the Uganda National Drug Policy and Authority Act. This includes donated products intended to support medical assistance efforts. The importation of expired products is prohibited, and many products require a market authorization issued by the Uganda National Drug Authority to be legally imported. Prohibited items are subject to seizure and importers can face criminal and civil action. Inquiries and applications for import authorizations should be sent to the Uganda National Drug Authority via  ndaug@nda.or.ug .   \nMedical facilities in Uganda are limited and only equipped to handle minor medical emergencies. Surgical capabilities are inadequate, and blood supplies may be insufficient. Outside Kampala, hospitals are scarce and offer only basic services. Travelers should carry their own supplies of prescription drugs and preventive medicines. \nA list of medical providers  is available at the U.S. Embassy website. We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic. \nFor emergency services in Uganda,  dial 999 .\nAmbulance services are not widely available and training and availability of emergency responders may be below U.S. standards.\nThe U.S. Embassy does not pay medical bills .

Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription.\nThe following diseases are known to occur in Uganda:\nVaccinations : Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nRoad Conditions and Safety : Nighttime travel should be avoided whenever possible. Highway travel at night is particularly dangerous, including on the roads between Entebbe Airport and Kampala. The Embassy recommends caution on these roads and use of a reliable taxi service to and from the airport. With the exception of the Kampala-Entebbe airport road, U.S. Embassy employees are prohibited from driving after dark on roads outside the limits of cities and large towns. Alcohol is frequently a contributing factor in road accidents, particularly at night.\nPedestrians often walk in the roads and may not be visible to motorists. Large branches or rocks in the road sometimes indicate an upcoming obstruction or other hazards. Ugandan law requires that the drivers stop and exchange information and assist any person injured in an accident. Mob anger and violence against the driver perceived to be at fault may occur. In these instances, Ugandans often do not get out of their cars, but drive to the nearest police station to report the accident.\nRoad conditions in the rural areas are poor. The use of four-wheel drive vehicles is encouraged in Uganda, and vehicular accidents occur at a high rate. Masaka Highway has been identified as one of the most dangerous roads in the world.\nPublic Transportation : Most inter-city transportation in Uganda is by small van or large bus. Many drivers of these vehicles have little training, and some are reckless. Vans and buses are often poorly maintained, travel at high speeds, and are the most common vehicles involved in the many deadly single- and multi-vehicle accidents along Ugandan roads. Accident victims have included U.S. citizens traveling in vans and personal cars, as passengers on motorcycle taxis locally known as \"boda bodas,\" and as pedestrians. U.S. Mission employees and their dependents are prohibited from using boda bodas and matatus (minibus taxis) due to accident and crime risks. Large trucks on the highways are often overloaded with inadequately secured cargo and poor braking systems.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight : As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Uganda, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Uganda’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards.

The Embassy will be able to assist with contacting police and provide you with a list of local shelters.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not occur everywhere. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally able to access areas outside of major cities and to provide necessary medical treatment, but it may take time for them to arrive. Local law requires foreigners to have medical insurance when traveling to Ukraine. U.S. citizens are encouraged to consider purchasing additional  medical evacuation insurance  when arranging their medical insurance for traveling to Ukraine. \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. If you are arrested, you can face extended periods, even years, in pre-trial detention. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs are severe, and if convicted you can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Furthermore, some violations of laws in Ukraine are also prosecutable in the U.S., regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrests:  When in a foreign country, you are subject the country’s laws. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  See the  Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report  and the following webpages for details\nLGB Travelers:  LGB individuals have been the target of harassment, threats, and acts of violence. For more detailed information about LGB rights in Ukraine, you may review the State Department’s Country Reports on  Human Rights Practices for 2017 .  For further information on LGB travel, please read our  Information for LGB Travelers page.\nSee   our  LGB Travel Information  page and section six of our  Human Rights Report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:   Accessibility is an issue in Ukraine. Public transport systems are not fully accessible to individuals with disabilities. Some newer buildings feature ramps and elevators, but older buildings do not. You should check ahead with your hotel/destination to learn more about options to accommodate disabled traveler needs before visiting Ukraine. See our  Traveling with Disabilities  page.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  women travelers .\nBy Ukrainian law, all foreigners coming to Ukraine must have medical insurance covering their period of travel. Note that the general quality of healthcare in Ukraine does not meet U.S. standards.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance overseas.\nWe do not pay medical bills. Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas .  We strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nMedication:  If traveling with prescription medication, check with the  State Register of Medicines  (Ukrainian language only) to ensure the medication is legal to bring into the country, as many medications that are legal in the United States are prohibited in Ukraine. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. \nThe following diseases are prevalent in Ukraine:\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:\nIn case of accidents:\nTraffic Laws:   \nPublic Transportation:\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of Ukraine’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Ukraine’s air carrier operations.

The fee is 35 UAE dirhams and is payable only in the local currency.\nPlease verify this information with the  Embassy of the United Arab Emirates  before you travel.\nExit Controls:  The UAE maintains tight exit controls. All travelers must exit the country with the passport on which they entered. Travelers should visit a UAE immigration office prior to departure to obtain an exit pass if they plan to leave the UAE without the passport on which they entered.\nTravelers both departing the UAE and transiting will be barred from exiting the UAE if there are any criminal or civil legal cases against them. Travelers have been arrested at the airport and have had their passports seized due to outstanding financial cases, unsettled legal disputes, and late credit card payments, including for cases that were previously unknown to the traveler. In such cases, some individuals have been arrested and detained for long periods of time. Individuals will be barred from leaving the UAE until legal cases are settled in full. This affects all persons whether they are in the UAE as residents, tourists, or transit passengers with no intention of exiting the airport. UAE residents can verify with UAE authorities whether they have an exit ban due to outstanding cases in Dubai or Abu Dhabi. More information on this process can be found on the  UAE Government Portal .\nThe Government of the UAE requires that all persons residing in the country have a national identification card. U.S. citizens who are working or living in the UAE should visit the  Emirates Identity Authority website  for more information on card registration procedures and requirements.\nCancellation of Visas:  All UAE visas must be formally cancelled through the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA) before a new visa can be issued. This includes visas that have already expired or have never been used. Travelers may be denied entry to, or not permitted to depart, the UAE if previous visas have not been properly cancelled. More information on the process is available on the  UAE Government portal .\nDual Nationality:  The UAE does not recognize dual nationality. The UAE recognizes only the citizenship of the passport on which a person enters the UAE. The embassy may be prohibited from providing certain consular services to those who did not enter the UAE on a U.S. passport.\nThe UAE has imposed HIV/AIDS travel restrictions on all foreigners seeking residency. Travelers for tourism are not tested or requested to provide information about HIV/AIDS status. Please verify this information with the  Embassy of the UAE  before you travel. Information about  dual nationality  and the  prevention of international child abduction  can be found on our website. For further information about customs regulations, please read the embassy’s  Customs Information page .\nCurrent restrictions:\nWeapons and Law Enforcement Equipment:  The transportation of arms or items that may be considered law enforcement or military equipment is strictly prohibited without written approval from the UAE government. Do not transport any arms or items that may be considered law enforcement or military equipment. Such items include, but are not limited to:\nU.S. citizens, military personnel, and U.S. government/military contractors found to be carrying such items, even in the smallest quantities, will be arrested and face strict criminal penalties, including imprisonment, large monetary fines, forfeiture of the items, and deportation , even though airlines and U.S. authorities allowed shipment on a U.S.-originating flight.\nOther prohibited items:  Importation of the following items is also prohibited under UAE law: pornographic material, non-Islamic religious pamphlets for missionary activities, e-cigarettes, fireworks, ivory, chemical and organic fertilizers, laser pointers, radar jammers/other unauthorized communication devices, products and medications containing cannabidiol (CBD), endangered animal species, and any objects, sculptures, paintings, books or magazines which do not adhere to the religious and moral values of the UAE. Possession of any of these items can lead to detention and lengthy jail sentences.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nU.S. citizens in the United Arab Emirates should exercise a high level of security awareness. The possibility of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and interests in the Gulf and Arabian Peninsula remains a serious concern. The UAE’s normalization of relations with Israel in September 2020 increased the potential for attacks in the UAE, including by Iran-backed entities. Separately, rebel groups operating in Yemen have stated an intent to attack neighboring countries, including the UAE, using missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones). Yemen-based Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for missile and drone attacks against the UAE on January 17 and 24, 2022, targeting populated areas and civilian infrastructure.  The January 17 attack resulted in multiple impact sites in Abu Dhabi and three fatalities. The Houthi rebels have publicly stated their intent to continue such attacks. In the event of a missile and/or drone strike, follow the guidance found  here .\nBoth historical and current information suggest that the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), al-Qaida, and affiliated organizations continue to plan attacks against Western targets; these attacks may employ a wide variety of tactics, including suicide operations, assassination, kidnapping, hijacking, and bombing.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nBoating:  The UAE and Iran have had a long-standing dispute concerning jurisdiction of Abu Musa, approximately 20 miles from Dubai. Fishing or sailing in these waters may result in seizure of vessels and detention of passengers and crew in Iran. Obtaining consular assistance in Iran for U.S. citizens is difficult and can only be done through the  Swiss Embassy in Tehran , which acts as a Protecting Power, providing limited U.S. consular services.\nCrime:  Violent crimes and crimes against property are rare. U.S. citizens should take the same security precautions in the UAE that one would practice in the United States or any large city abroad.\nHarassment and Assault:  U.S. citizens, especially women, should take precautions against the possibility of verbal and physical harassment or sexual assault when walking alone, consuming alcohol, or riding in a taxi cab. Taxi passengers should avoid sitting in the front seat of a taxicab and should be sensitive that \"small talk\" can be misinterpreted as over-friendliness or even a form of propositioning by some taxi drivers. Taxis driven by women for the exclusive use of female passengers are available in some airports and by dispatch. Female travelers can identify these dedicated vehicles by their pink roofs.\nSome victims of sexual assault have been prosecuted for violating laws against sexual relations outside of marriage. The law puts a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sex was not consensual. In cases where the victim has failed to demonstrate so, both parties have been prosecuted, and sometimes sentenced to jail time, followed by deportation.\nInternational Financial Scams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in the UAE. Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help. Common scams include:\nVictims of Crime:  U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy for assistance. Report crimes to the local police at  999  and contact the U.S. Embassy at +971 2 414 2200. Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is generally regulated and rules with regard to best practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and professional staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is widely available throughout the country. Outside of a major metropolitan center, it may take more time for first responders and medical professionals to stabilize a patient and provide life-saving assistance. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nAs each emirate has its own independent judicial system, legal procedures and penalties vary throughout the country.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our  website on crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  UAE authorities do not routinely notify the U.S. Embassy or consulate of a U.S. citizen’s arrest.  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or consulate immediately.  If you are not allowed to do so, ask a friend or family member to contact the U.S. Embassy or consulate. See our  webpage  for further information.\nAlcohol:  Alcohol is sold only in very limited areas including certain restaurants and hotels. Public drunkenness and driving under the influence, regardless of one’s blood alcohol content level, are considered very serious offenses. Persons arrested on alcohol-related offenses are regularly detained for many days as they await a court hearing. Penalties may include hefty jail sentences, substantial fines and, for Muslims (even those holding U.S. citizenship), lashings. \n \n Note:  The possession and consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the emirate of Sharjah.\nDrugs:  UAE law imposes the death sentence for convicted drug traffickers. Possession of even trace amounts of illegal drugs (including in the bloodstream) can result in lengthy prison sentences of up to 15 years. Bail generally is not granted to those accused of drug crimes.\nPossession or consumption of marijuana in any form, including detections of trace amounts in the bloodstream, is illegal in the UAE, even if a doctor’s medical card is presented. Products containing cannabidiol (CBD) are illegal in the UAE. Possession or importation of CBD products, including those found in prescription and over the counter medications in the United States and other countries, are prosecuted in the same manner as marijuana possession. The UAE's anti-narcotics program also includes poppy seeds on its list of controlled substances. The importation and possession of poppy seeds in any and all forms, including as dried decorative plants, are strictly prohibited.\nPersons may be charged and convicted even if the controlled substances were ingested outside of the UAE as long as traces are still present in the bloodstream upon arrival in the UAE. If suspected of being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, individuals may be required to submit to blood and/or urine tests and may be subject to prosecution.\nTravelers with questions regarding the items on the  list of controlled substances  should contact the  U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi  or the  U.S. Consulate General in Dubai .\nCodes of Behavior and Dress:  Public decency and morality laws throughout the UAE are much stricter than in the United States. Penalties for public displays of affection or immodesty may be imposed. Sexual relations outside marriage are illegal in the UAE and convicted individuals have been punished by lengthy jail sentences. Pregnancy outside of marriage can result in arrest and detention. Doctors may ask for proof of marriage during pre-natal visits, and those giving birth in the UAE must present a marriage certificate to receive medical care and register the child’s birth. Failure to do so has resulted in the arrests of both unmarried mothers and fathers, as well as deportation.\nIndividuals may be arrested, fined, and/or deported for committing any of the following acts: making rude gestures, swearing, touching another person without his/her permission, and making derogatory statements about the UAE, the royal families, the local governments or other people. Travelers should keep in mind the cultural differences among the many people who coexist in the UAE and should be cognizant that unwitting actions, including clothing choices, may invite unwanted attention.\nDebt and Financial Crime:  Crimes of financial fraud, including passing bad checks and non-payment or late payment of bills (including hotel bills, hospital bills, traffic or parking fines, and late payment of credit cards, utility bills, etc.), are regarded seriously in the UAE and often result in imprisonment and/or fines. A personal check written as a guarantee for the payment of a personal or business debt may be submitted to a local bank for collection at any time for the full amount of the check. If the account holder does not have sufficient funds, he/she may be charged with passing a bad check. Bail generally is not available to non-residents of the UAE who are arrested for crimes involving fraud. Debtors can be held in prison until their debts are paid or until an agreement is reached between the parties. Passports may be seized by the UAE government to guarantee that debtors settle their cases. Financial cases may be further complicated by debtors being unable to work in the UAE without passports while still being held responsible for their debts.\nPhotography:  Taking photographs of UAE military facilities, sensitive civilian sites, airports, some beaches, or foreign diplomatic missions – including the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General – may result in arrest, detention, and/or prosecution by local authorities. Travelers should be aware of signs which indicate where photography is prohibited. Note that it is illegal to take photographs of other people without their consent. In addition, engaging in mapping activities, especially mapping that includes the use of GPS equipment, without coordination with UAE authorities, may have the same consequences. (This does not apply to use of publicly available online maps.)\nDrone Operation:  The flying of drones is prohibited in certain areas and may result in arrest and imprisonment. Individuals should not operate drones without prior approval from local authorities.\nSocial Media:  The UAE has strict laws regarding use of the internet and social media. Individuals have been arrested and criminally convicted for posting information on social media sites (such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) that local authorities determined was disturbing to the order of the UAE. Users of social media should be cautious about online posting of information that might be deemed to insult or challenge the local or national government. Individuals should avoid posting insults or derogatory information about governments, institutions, or individuals.\nCharity and fundraising activities are closely regulated by the UAE government, and it is against the law to conduct any private fundraising activity online (including those conducted on popular fundraising websites for personal causes).\nThe UAE National Media Council has rules for conducting business as a social media influencer in the UAE. Influencers must apply for trade and e-media licenses in order to promote brands on social media in the UAE. \nTerrorist Organizations List:  On November 15, 2014, the UAE government announced a list of 85 groups it considers to be terrorist organizations. Individuals who are associated with groups on the UAE list could be detained at UAE borders, have their assets frozen, and/or be prosecuted for membership in a terrorist organization.\nReligious Proselytizing:  While individuals are free to worship as they choose, and facilities are available for that purpose, religious proselytizing is not permitted in the UAE. Persons violating this law, even unknowingly, may be imprisoned or deported.\nEmployment in the UAE:  Although it is common for a local sponsor to hold an employee's passport, it is illegal to do so under UAE law. Many contractual or labor disputes can be avoided by clearly establishing all terms and conditions of employment or sponsorship in the labor contract at the beginning of any employment. Should a dispute arise, the UAE Ministry of Labor has established a special department to review and arbitrate labor claims. If an employee leaves his/her job without properly canceling the employment visa, the employer can file charges that can lead to imprisonment, fines, and/or deportation. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General do not intercede in employment disputes.\nU.S. citizens have become involved in commercial or financial disputes that have prompted local firms or courts to take possession of the U.S. citizen's passport, effectively preventing the individual from leaving the UAE. In addition, local firms have been known to file criminal complaints, which may lead not only to travel restrictions but possible criminal penalties, including jail time. A list of local attorneys is available from the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai.\nDocument Authentications:  U.S. citizens intending to reside and work in the UAE are generally required by the UAE government to present authenticated personal documents for themselves and accompanying family members such as marriage and birth certificates, adoption and custody decrees, certificates of good behavior from police, and educational documents to include diplomas and certificates. The authentication of U.S. documents is done completely in the United States. For information, contact the State Department’s  Office of Authentications . Determining the exact requirements with one’s prospective employer is strongly recommended before arrival in the UAE.\nLGB Travelers:  Although the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulate General are not aware of any recent arrests or prosecutions for consensual, same-sex relations and cross-dressing, they remain illegal in the UAE. See our  LGB Travel Information page  and section six of our Human Rights  report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  While in the UAE, individuals with disabilities may find accessibility and accommodations somewhat different from what they find in the United States. The law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, air travel and other transportation, access to health care, or the provision of other state services, and the law is enforced. The UAE government refers to persons with disabilities as “people of determination.” Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is as prevalent as in the United States. The most common types of accessibility may include accessible facilities, information, and communication/access to services/ease of movement or access.\nThe UAE has several modern cities with good services and accessibility of lodging, public transportation, sidewalks, and buildings. Outside of newly constructed areas, accessibility is not comparable to the United States and navigating with a visual impairment or using a wheelchair is difficult due to sidewalks in disrepair or without curb cuts, poor road crossings, and inaccessible buildings and public transport. Public transportation in Dubai is wheelchair accessible. However, the buses that connect Dubai with the other emirates in the UAE are not wheelchair accessible. See the  UAE government information  on accessible transport and parking facilities. See our  Traveling with Disabilities  page.\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips.\nAdequate health facilities are available, but health care in rural areas may be below U.S. standards. While most common conditions can be appropriately treated in the UAE, complex medical conditions may be better treated in the United States. Providers may recommend a large number of procedures and tests, some of which may be unnecessary.\nFor emergency services in the UAE, dial  999 .\nAmbulance services are widely available.\nWe do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. You may be denied care, even in an emergency, if you are unable to provide a cash deposit up-front. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance overseas. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nWe strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nMedication:  Many prescription and over-the-counter medications are prohibited in the UAE, and possession of such substances without the appropriate approval is generally treated the same as possession of illegal narcotics. All tourists and residents of the UAE should seek prior approval, via an online form, before carrying certain types of medications, narcotics, or chemical substances to or through the UAE. The service can be accessed directly on the Ministry of Health and Prevention’s  website . Travelers can also find updated lists of prohibited medications requiring prior approval on the same website.\nTravelers with prescription medication must have their prescriptions issued by licensed doctors and authenticated by the appropriate authorities. In order for a U.S. prescription to be fully authenticated, it must be authenticated by the Secretary of State of the U.S. state in which the prescribing doctor is licensed, then by the U.S. Department of State, and finally by the UAE Embassy in Washington, DC.  Additional information on authentication of documents  can be found on the State Department’s website and on the  Embassy and Consulate General website . Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription.\nFurther queries may be directed to the  UAE Ministry of Health’s Drug Control Department  in Abu Dhabi.\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nFor further health information, go to:\nAir Quality:  Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates.\nThe U.S. Embassy and Consulate General maintain a  list of doctors and hospitals . We do not endorse or recommend any specific medical provider or clinic.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic accidents are a leading cause of death in the UAE. Drivers often drive at high speeds. Unsafe driving practices are common, especially on inter-city highways. On highways, unmarked speed bumps and drifting sand create additional hazards. Pedestrians should also use great care on the roads of the UAE – over 25 percent of road fatalities are pedestrians.\nThe police emergency number and ambulance number is  999 . Response time by emergency services is adequate; however, medical personnel emphasize transport of the injured to the hospital rather than treatment on site.\nTraffic Laws:  Country-wide traffic laws impose stringent penalties for certain violations, particularly driving under the influence of alcohol. In the UAE, there is zero tolerance for driving after consuming alcohol.\nPersons involved in an accident in which another party is injured automatically go to jail until the injured person is released from the hospital. Should a person die in a traffic accident, the driver of the other vehicle is liable for payment of compensation for the death (known as \"dhiyya\"), usually the equivalent of 55,000 U.S. dollars. Even relatively minor accidents may result in lengthy proceedings, during which both drivers may be prohibited from leaving the country.\nIn order to drive, UAE residents must obtain a UAE driver's license. Foreign driver’s licenses are not recognized for residents of the UAE; however, U.S. citizen visitors who are not UAE residents can drive using a valid driver’s license issued by his or her state. An international driver’s license may be required in some emirates. The UAE recognizes driver's licenses issued by other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states only if the bearer is driving a vehicle registered to the same GCC state. Under no circumstances should anyone drive without a valid license.\nIf you are in an accident, UAE law mandates that you remain at the scene until authorities arrive. The use of front seat belts is mandatory in the UAE. Driving is on the right side of the road. Speed limits are posted. Making a right turn on a red light is not permitted unless there is a special lane to do so with a yield sign. Parking is not allowed where the curb is painted black and yellow. Digital cameras are used extensively on Emirati roads for registering traffic violations, including speeding. Fines can be substantial and must be paid prior to departure from the UAE. Individuals with outstanding traffic fines may be detained at airport immigration.\nPlease see our  Road Safety page  for more information .\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Government of the United Arab Emirates’ Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of the United Arab Emirates’ air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page.\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to the UAE should also check for  U.S. maritime advisories and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard Homeport  and the  NGA Broadcast Warnings  website."

You must have a valid visa if you are traveling on a diplomatic or official passport. Visit the  Embassy of Uruguay website  for the most current visa information.\nThere is an airport tax \" boarding fee \" for departure. This fee is generally part of the airfare for international travel. Contact your travel agency or airline for more information. You may pay the fee at the airport with an international credit card or in U.S. dollars.\nTravel with Minors:  There are strict exit requirements for children under the age of 18 who remain in Uruguay for more than 365 days, regardless of citizenship or nationality. When a child remains in Uruguay for more than 365 days  and is traveling with only one parent, traveling alone, or traveling with someone other than the parents , the minor child is required to have a  Permiso de Menor  (permission for a minor) issued by the Uruguayan National Immigration Directorate prior to departing Uruguay. If the minor child does not have a Permiso de Menor, the minor child will be prohibited from leaving Uruguay.\nInstructions on obtaining a  Permiso de Menor  can be found on the  Government of Uruguay’s website  (Spanish only). The U.S. Embassy strongly advises all parents of minor children to be in possession of U.S. documentation needed to apply for a Permiso de Menor prior to initiating their travel to Uruguay. Please note that all U.S. documents used to apply for a Permiso de Menor must be apostilled by the U.S. state in which the document was issued to be considered valid by Uruguayan authorities. The process to apostille a document varies from state to state. Failing to apostille the necessary documents prior to entering Uruguay will delay the process of obtaining a  Permiso de Menor . The Uruguayan government also requires documents to be translated into Spanish by a certified, Uruguayan translator ( traductor público ).\nContact the  Embassy of Uruguay in the United States  with questions about required documentation.\nThe  Permiso de Menor  requirement does not apply to children assigned to Uruguay on official U.S. government orders who are traveling on diplomatic or official passports.\nThe U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to, or foreign residents of, Uruguay.\nInformation about  dual nationality  or the  prevention of international child abduction  can be found on our  website . For further information about customs regulations, please read our  Customs Information  page.\nCrime:  The volume of crimes against persons and property, to include homicides, is high throughout Uruguay. Street crime, including armed robberies, theft and carjackings occur in tourist centers within Montevideo with large numbers of tourists, such as Ciudad Vieja, the Rambla, and the neighborhood around the U.S. Embassy. Even upscale residential neighborhoods, such as Punta Carretas, Pocitos, and Carrasco are not immune to criminal activity. Maintain situational awareness and practice good personal security at all times while traveling throughout Uruguay as criminals typically seek out victims in vulnerable situations.\nThefts, burglaries, armed robberies, assaults, and other violent crimes are common throughout Uruguay. Criminals tend to conduct surveillance on potential targets including ATMs, residences, restaurants, vehicles, and individuals prior to committing robberies. Criminals regularly travel in pairs on motorcycles to approach unsuspecting victims with a weapon and demand personal belongings before fleeing. They attempt to catch victims off-guard by driving slowly next to their vehicles and waiting for them to get out of their car to rob them. Other times, they break car windows to steal valuables from vehicles that are parked or stuck in traffic.\nBe vigilant when using ATMs, especially during non-daylight hours. Criminals frequently use gas-induced explosive devices to steal from ATMs.\nThe following Montevideo neighborhoods have higher crime rates, and official U.S. government personnel are recommended to avoid or limit travel to these areas:\nDuring the summer months (December-March), many cities in Uruguay experience an increase of petty street crime, residential burglaries, and robberies, especially in beach towns such as Punta del Este, La Barra, La Paloma, Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, and Punta del Diablo. Criminals also target vehicles traveling to these and other popular destinations.\nPolice cars are clearly marked and equipped with cellular phones. While professional and well-trained, local police do not maintain a robust physical presence to deter criminal activity throughout Montevideo, which often results in a delayed response. Most police officers do not speak English.\nDemonstrations:  Demonstrations, some expressing anti-U.S. sentiment, regularly occur in Uruguay, particularly near the Legislative Palace, City Hall, Parque Batlle, Plaza Libertad, and the universities in Montevideo. Protests directed toward the U.S. government, usually small in size, can occur around the U.S. Embassy. U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Uruguay should avoid large gatherings or events where crowds congregate to demonstrate, protest, or cause damage as a byproduct of celebrating an event, such as after soccer matches.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at 911 and contact the U.S. Embassy at (598) 1770-2000 or  MontevideoACS@state.gov . Remember that local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nWe can:\nScams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence may contact the U.S. Embassy at (598) 1770-2000 or  MontevideoACS@state.gov  for assistance. If you are in immediate danger, call the police at 911.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase  medical evacuation insurance . \nCriminal Penalties:  While in Uruguay you are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.Furthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are  arrested or detained , ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCustoms Requirements:  Uruguay's Customs authorities may enforce strict regulations concerning temporary importation or exportation of certain items. These include precious jewels, gold, firearms, pornography, inflammable articles, acids, prohibited drugs, plants, seeds, and foodstuffs as well as antiquities and business equipment. Uruguayan Customs also prohibits the importation of subversive materials aimed at overthrowing the government or promoting anarchy, genocide, or other globally condemned practices. Contact the  Embassy of Uruguay  in Washington, D.C., or one of Uruguay's consulates in the United States for specific information regarding customs requirements.\nTourists are permitted to import personal effects, including jewelry, cameras, computers, sporting goods, etc., free of duty or taxes. Travelers bringing commercial goods into Uruguay must declare them to customs officers at the port of entry or face possible detention or seizure of the goods and criminal charges. Please see our  customs webpage  for more information.\nMarijuana Policy:  Recent changes in legislation allow Uruguayan citizens and permanent residents of Uruguay to purchase limited amounts of marijuana at government-approved pharmacies, join a registered marijuana club, or grow a limited amount of marijuana for personal use. Please note it remains illegal for tourists and other foreign visitors in Uruguay to purchase and consume marijuana. Anyone who purchases or consumes marijuana, and who does not fit into a legal category of use, may be arrested and prosecuted under Uruguayan law.\nFaith-Based Travelers:  Faith-based travel includes a wide variety of activities, including pilgrimages, service projects, missionary work, and cruises, among others. See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:  There are no legal restrictions on adult, same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Uruguay. See our  LGB Travel Information  page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers Who Require Accessibility Assistance:  Uruguayan law prohibits discrimination against persons with disabilities, but the government does not effectively enforce these provisions. Transportation services are generally not equipped for access by persons with disabilities. Sidewalks and crosswalks are often in need of maintenance and/or accessibility ramps and can present challenges to persons with disabilities.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nMedical care facilities in Uruguay are considered adequate and most are comparable to U.S. standards. The responsiveness of emergency, personal ambulance service is generally within U.S. standards; however there may be service delays if questions about health insurance coverage arise. Ambulances are staffed with a medical doctor, enabling advanced treatment/care en route to the local hospital.\nThe U.S. Government does not pay medical bills, and U.S. Medicare does not apply overseas. Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to the United States can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\nMake sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Travelers on cruise ships with stops in Uruguay are strongly urged to verify their overseas health insurance coverage. Most health care providers in Uruguay accept cash and credit card payments. See our  webpage  for more information on insurance overseas. We strongly recommend  supplemental insurance  to cover medical evacuation.\nCarry prescription medication in original packaging with your doctor’s prescription. There is no restriction on types of medication that can be imported for personal use. Some medications may not be available in Uruguay, so bring a sufficient supply for your stay.\nWhile rare, the Uruguayan summer can bring about an increase in diarrheal illness and mosquito-borne diseases, so the use of insect repellent is advisable.\nVaccinations: Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are no special vaccination requirements for Uruguay.\nFurther health information:\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic fatalities are among the most common causes of death in Uruguay. According to the  World Health Organization , Uruguay’s rate of traffic deaths per 100,000 people is 16.6, nearly 50 percent higher than that of the United States. According to the Uruguayan National Road Safety Unit, motorcyclists and bicyclists account for 70 percent of transit-related fatalities.\nIllumination, pavement markings, and road surfaces for secondary roads can be poor. Several of the main highways are particularly accident-ridden because of heavy tourist traffic speed-related accidents including: Route 1 (between Montevideo and Colonia), the Ruta Interbalnearia (between Montevideo and Punta del Este), Route 9 to the east (that leads to Punta del Diablo, La Paloma, La Pedrera, and Cabo Polonia), and Route 2 (between Rosario and Fray Bentos). The frequency of road accidents rises during the summer beach season (December to March), Carnaval (mid-to-late February), and Easter week.\nIf you are in an accident involving injury, stay in place until a police officer arrives. The insurance company will generally respond to the scene as well. Some major roads are centrally monitored via live camera feeds and emergency response may arrive quickly. You should contact 911 immediately to report an emergency, and notify your rental company if in a rental car.\nUruguayan law requires your vehicle to be equipped with a specific road safety kit (hazard cones, flares, reflective vest, fire extinguisher, etc.), which you can find at most grocery stores or gas stations. Rental vehicles should have these basic kits.\nDial 911 in an emergency. For emergency roadside assistance, call the Automobile Club of Uruguay at 1707 or \"Car Up\" at 2628-1555. Even if you are not a member, tourists can use this fee-based service.\nTraffic Laws:\nPublic Transportation:  Ride sharing services are monitored to ensure that they comply with safety standards at least equal to those applied to the taxi system. Taxis can be hailed from the street, by phone (141), or by using one of several apps. Most taxis do not have functioning seat belts in the back seat. Public buses can be crowded, and patrons are sometimes targeted by pickpockets and bag snatchers. The public bus system utilizes pre-determined routes and is generally dependable.\nRegular labor strikes can halt public transportation with minimal advance notice. Travelers should have alternative plans, such as ride sharing apps, or consider hiring a private executive car (remise). All of these options are usually reliable during mass shutdowns of public transportation.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information. Visit the website of Uruguay’s  national tourist office  and  Montevideo’s Transit Authority Manual  (Spanish only).\nAviation Safety Oversight:  As there is no direct commercial air service to the United States by carriers registered in Uruguay, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed the government of Uruguay’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. Further information may be found on the FAA’s  safety assessment page ."

U.S. citizens should apply for physical visas well in advance of their travel and should apply through Uzbekistan’s consular missions abroad, including the Embassy of Uzbekistan in Washington, D.C. A list of Uzbekistan’s consular missions abroad is available on the official website of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs .\nE-Visas:  Travelers wishing to enter for Uzbekistan for tourism for 30 days or less may apply for an e-visa. E-visa application processing, including fees and visa validity, can be found by visiting the  Embassy of Uzbekistan website . The e-visa application is submitted through the government of Uzbekistan’s  e-visa portal .\nTips for entering Uzbekistan on an E-Visa: \nVisa-free Entry for U.S. Citizens under 16:  U.S. citizens who are under 16 and traveling for tourism are eligible for a visa-free regime. They should present a valid U.S. passport at the point of entry and must be accompanied by their legal guardians. The period of stay generally will correspond with the duration of the visa of the accompanying guardian and will not exceed 90 days. More information is available at the  Embassy of Uzbekistan  website.\nVisa-free Entry for Foreign Citizens over 55:  U.S. citizens who are older than 55 and traveling for tourism are eligible for a visa-free regime with a valid passport.

Travelers should obtain a multiple-entry Uzbek visa as well as proper visas for the relevant neighboring countries, if needed.\nAirport Screening Procedures:  All travelers should anticipate strict airport security screening procedures. Travelers wishing to be screened privately should note secondary screening procedures are more thorough than those conducted at the primary security checkpoint.\nHIV/AIDS:  Some HIV/AIDS entry restrictions exist for visitors and foreign residents of Uzbekistan. Long-term visitors may be required to submit HIV test results along with their visa application. For more information, contact the  Embassy of Uzbekistan  before you travel.\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction  and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nDemonstrations  are rare and unlikely to occur, particularly inside Tashkent. However, clashes between police and protesters have resulted in deaths in the past.\nCrime:  Violent crime against foreign nationals is rare, but can occur, especially in larger cities and primarily during late night hours. In urban areas, travelers are urged to take the same precautions they would take in any large U.S. city. If traveling at night, stay in well-lit areas, travel in groups, maintain a low profile, and do not display large amounts of cash. Beware of pickpockets in public places, such as tourist destinations, train stations, and local markets. Although using private cars as taxis is common in Uzbekistan, U.S. citizens, especially women, should not consider this a safe practice. U.S. citizens are encouraged to use clearly marked taxis, such as those at hotels, and should avoid riding in unmarked taxis.\nScams:  See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for information on scams.\nVictims of Crime:  Report crimes to the local police at 102 (Tashkent) or 02 (most of Uzbekistan) and to the U.S. Embassy at + (998) (78) 120-5450.\nWe can:\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy for assistance.\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur.

First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities and to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more information on  insurance providers for overseas coverage.\nCriminal Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the foreign countries they visit. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business.\nFurthermore, certain acts of U.S. citizens overseas are prosecutable as crimes in the United States even if they are not illegal under the local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries and they may be illegal according to the local laws.

The law does not specifically address same-sex sexual activity between women. Same-sex sexual activity is a taboo subject in Uzbekistani society, and there are no registered LGB organizations. See   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:  The law in Uzbekistan prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities, and the law is enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Buildings, public transportation, and social infrastructure facilities, such as clinics and schools, are rarely adapted for use by persons with disabilities. \nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nMedical care in Uzbekistan is below U.S. standards with shortages of basic medical supplies, including disposable needles, anesthetics, and antibiotics. Some medication sold in local pharmacies is known to be counterfeit. Elderly travelers and those with pre-existing health problems may be at particular risk due to inadequate medical facilities. Most resident U.S. citizens travel to North America or Europe for their medical needs.\nGenerally, in hospitals only minimal staff is available overnight, and medical staff may speak little or no English.  Patients bear all costs for transfer to or between hospitals.  Psychological and psychiatric services are limited, even in the larger cities, with hospital-based care only available through government institutions.\nFor emergency services in Uzbekistan, dial 103 (Tashkent) or 03 (most of Uzbekistan).\n Other provider numbers are:\nAmbulance services are:\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies, and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.

Bottled water and beverages are generally safe. Be aware that ice for drinks may be made using tap water.\nAir Quality : Visit  AirNow Department of State  for information on air quality at U.S. Embassies and Consulates. Air pollution is a significant problem in major cities in Uzbekistan. Consider the impact seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you and consult your doctor before traveling if necessary.\nAdventure Travel:  Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information about  Adventure Travel .\nU.S. Embassy Tashkent’s Consular Section maintains a list of  medical contacts\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Uzbekistan has a developed but inconsistently maintained traffic infrastructure. Although main roads in central Tashkent are relatively well maintained, many secondary roads inside and outside Tashkent are in poor condition. Exercise caution on rural or mountainous roads.\nDriving at night can be dangerous. Rural roads and highways are generally not lit, and only major cities have streetlights. The fuel supply can be sporadic, and travelers may encounter occasional difficulty finding gasoline outside Tashkent.\nLivestock, as well as farm equipment and animal-drawn carts that lack lights or reflectors, are found on both urban and rural roads at any hour. Local drivers are unfamiliar with safe driving techniques. Drivers often disregard traffic signals, ignore lane markings, and move erratically and at high speeds. Pedestrians cross streets unexpectedly and often without looking for oncoming traffic.\nPassersby and drivers generally respond quickly to automobile accidents and notify relevant authorities; however, police may not arrive at the scene right away. There are private roadside assistance services available in Uzbekistan that can assist with towing, fuel refill, tire replacement, etc.\nTraffic Laws:   Uzbekistan has a large traffic police force, which frequently stops drivers for minor infractions or simple document checks. There have been reports of traffic police harassing foreign drivers and asking them for bribes.\nPublic Transportation:  Public transportation in the city is often overcrowded and not always safe. Avoid using unmarked taxis or entering a cab that already has passengers.  Most taxis lack working seatbelts in the back seat.  Buses and shuttle buses (marshrutkas), especially in residential areas, lack necessary route maps and information, and driver schedules may be unpredictable.\nSee our  Road Safety page  for more information.\nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Uzbekistan’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Uzbekistan’s air carrier operations.

See   our  LGB Travel Information   page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:\nThe law in Vanuatu does not prohibit discrimination against persons with physical, sensory, intellectual, or mental disabilities. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Accessibility is generally more prevalent in the capital city, Port Vila. The availability of rental, repair, replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices, or service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants is extremely limited.\nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nRoad Conditions and Safety:   Travel by road can be hazardous. Always use your seatbelt. Roads are generally narrow and in poor repair. Only the capital city of Port Vila and the town of Luganville have consistently paved roads, which have a maximum speed limit of 30 miles per hour (50 kilometers per hour). On all roads, give way to traffic coming from the right, and to traffic coming from the left at roundabouts. To avoid trespassing, seek permission from local landowners before accessing non-public areas, including beaches. Some landowners may charge a fee for access.\nTraffic Laws:   If you are involved in a road accident, local law requires you to stop and stay at the scene until the police arrive. If a crowd gathers after an accident and you feel threatened, proceed directly to a police station. Incidents of individuals being harmed by crowds as a result of a traffic accident are rare.\nMany local drivers are not well trained and do not follow basic traffic laws. Be aware of drivers under the influence of alcohol, pedestrians who are not aware of traffic, and children running into the road. Drivers have very limited visibility due to a lack of roadway illumination. Police control of traffic is limited, even in Port Vila. When driving, be alert at all times. Street signs and traffic lights are scarce or may not be in working order. \nPublic Transportation:   Taxi services are widely available in Port Vila and Luganville and are generally safe.

If not, you face refusal of admission, expulsion, or detention.\nImmigration officials often require proof of accommodation while in Venezuela, adequate means of support, and an onward departure itinerary. Use only official crossing points when entering Venezuela. You must obtain an entry stamp upon entry.\nIf you reside in Venezuela as a non-citizen, you must obtain legitimate Venezuelan residency documentation and renew your residency visa well in advance of expiration. Do not use intermediaries to purchase resident visas and/or work permits.\nTraveling with Children:  Venezuela’s child protection law mandates that minors (under 18) of any nationality who are traveling alone, with only one parent, or with a third party, must present extensive, specific, and notarized documentation granting permission for travel. Consult the nearest Venezuelan embassy or consulate for further information.\nDual Nationality:   Venezuelan law requires Venezuelan citizens to enter and depart Venezuela using Venezuelan passports. If you hold dual U.S. and Venezuelan nationality, you must plan to travel between the United States and Venezuela with valid U.S. and Venezuelan passports. Dual-national minors are only allowed to depart Venezuela with both parents present or with a legal authorization signed by the absent parent in a family court.\nImmunizations:  Visit the  CDC Traveler website  for vaccination information, including Yellow Fever vaccination requirements. Carry your International Certificate of Vaccination (or yellow card) with you upon arrival or departure. Travel to Venezuela no longer requires evidence of COVID-19 vaccination.\nHIV/AIDS:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Venezuela. Be aware that HIV/AIDS medications, like other medications, are often not available in Venezuela.\nFind further information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nTerrorism:  Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to more effectively target crowds. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\nTerrorist groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army (FARC-EP), Segunda Marquetalia, and the Colombian-origin National Liberation Army (ELN) have expanded in Venezuela in recent years. We are aware of reports of cooperation between FARC dissidents and the ELN in the areas of road/border checkpoints, forced displacement of communities, and narcotics trafficking.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nCrime:   Violent crime is pervasive throughout Venezuela. Venezuela has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, and kidnappings are a serious concern.\nIf you are in Venezuela:\nCriminal gangs operate openly and with little repercussion, often setting up fake police checkpoints. Armed robberies, including with grenades and assault rifles, take place throughout the country, including in tourist areas and institutions such as banks and ATMs, national parks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities.\nDrugs:   Do not attempt to bring any narcotics or controlled substances into Venezuela, or substances that may be confused with illegal drugs.\nTransportation:  \nMaiquetía International Airport:   Only travel to and from Maiquetía International Airport near Caracas in daylight hours. Kidnappings, robberies at gunpoint, thefts, and muggings are common. Individuals wearing seemingly official uniforms and displaying airport or police credentials have been involved in crimes inside the airport, including extortion and robberies.\nATMs:   Most ATMs do not accept U.S. debit or credit cards, and malfunctions are common. Many ATMs do not have cash. Criminals target ATM users for robberies. ATM data is often hacked and used to make unauthorized withdrawals.\nDemonstrations  occur occasionally.  They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.  \nInternational Financial Scams:   See the  Department of State  and the  FBI  pages for additional information.\nInternet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Venezuela.  Scams are often initiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters.  Scammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for help.  Common scams include: \nVictims of Crime:  The  U.S. Embassy in Caracas  suspended operations on March 11, 2019, and therefore cannot provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Venezuela. The U.S. Embassy in Colombia assists U.S. citizens in Venezuela when possible.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crimes overseas .\nWe can:\nDomestic Violence:   U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the  U.S. Embassy in Bogota  for assistance.\nColombian Border:  The area within 50-miles of the entire Venezuela and Colombian border is extremely dangerous. U.S. citizens near the border are at risk of detention by authorities. U.S. citizens must obtain a visa to enter Venezuela legally. Visas are not available upon arrival. U.S. citizens attempting to enter Venezuela without a visa have been charged with terrorism and other serious crimes and detained for long periods. Maduro authorities do not notify the U.S. government of the detention of U.S. citizens and the U.S. government is not granted access to those citizens. Additionally, cross-border violence, kidnapping, drug trafficking, and smuggling are common. Some kidnapping victims are released after ransom payments, while others are murdered.\nTourism:  Tourists participate in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment does not meet U.S. standards. Serious medical issues require costly medical evacuation complicated by restrictions on air travel to and from Venezuela. Air evacuations to the United States from Venezuela may not be possible.\nCriminal Penalties:  You are subject to local laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Application of local laws can at times be arbitrary and/or politically motivated.\nIn Venezuela, it is illegal to take pictures of sensitive buildings, including the presidential palace, military bases, government buildings, and airports.\nDrug trafficking is a serious problem in Venezuela and treated as such by Venezuelan authorities. Convicted traffickers receive lengthy prison sentences.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification:  If you are arrested or detained, attempt to have someone notify the U.S. Embassy in Bogota immediately. See our  webpage  for further information.\nPlease note that the U.S. Department of State may not be informed of your detention, particularly if you also hold Venezuelan citizenship. Due to the suspension of operations of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas, consular visits to detained U.S. citizens are not possible. There have been instances of U.S. citizens in recent years who have been detained without being afforded due process or fair trial guarantees, or as a pretext for an illegitimate purpose, often due to their U.S. citizenship. U.S. citizens in Venezuela are at risk of wrongful detention. See our  Travel Advisory for Venezuela  for additional information.\nCurrency and Exchange:   Venezuela has started to allow dollarized commercial transactions and shopping, but policies and availability are subject to change. Some local businesses accept U.S. credit cards and electronic transfers through certain online vendors. “Black market” currency exchanges – often offering significantly favorable exchange rates – are technically prohibited under Venezuelan foreign exchange controls. Violators may be detained by Venezuelan authorities and face criminal penalties.\nWire Transfers:   Wire transfers cannot be used reliably as a source of emergency funds, and receipt of funds is generally restricted to Venezuelan citizens and residents.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or forfeit the items if you attempt to bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice  website for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers:   See the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers:   There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of LGB events in Venezuela.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information page  and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities:   The law in Venezuela prohibits discrimination against persons with physical and mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public is not as prevalent as in the United States. Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure. Accessibility is more prevalent in the capital city of Caracas than in the rest of the country. \nThe availability of rental, repair, and replacement parts for aids/equipment/devices as well as service providers, such as sign language interpreters or personal assistants, is limited.\nStudents:   See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nWomen Travelers:  See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nTravel to Venezuela no longer requires evidence of COVID-19 vaccination.For emergency services in Venezuela, dial 171.

Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.\nMedical Insurance:   Most care providers overseas only accept cash payments. See  our webpage  for more information on insurance providers for overseas coverage. Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on types of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas.\nVaccinations:   You must be up to date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Yellow Fever vaccination is required if coming from or transiting for more than 12 hours through Brazil.\nHealth Facilities in General:\nMedical Tourism and Elective Surgery:\n  Pharmaceuticals: \nAssisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy :\nWater Quality:  \nAdventure Travel  :\nGeneral Health:\nThe following diseases are prevalent:\nThe Ministry of Health has announced they will start an epidemiological plan at airports for those travelers coming from countries where there is a confirmation of Mpox outbreak: \"To enter the country, they must report their health status and personal data in the epidemiological surveillance form, for medical follow-up”.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:\nTraffic Laws:\nPublic Transportation:   Subways, buses, trains, and other means of public transport in Venezuela do not have the same safety standards as in the United States. \n See our  Road Safety page  for more information. \nAviation Safety Oversight:   The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed that Venezuela’s Civil Aviation Authority is not in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Venezuela’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page .\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation issued an  order  suspending all nonstop flights between the United States and Venezuela. The Department of Homeland Security concluded that conditions in Venezuela threaten the safety and security of passengers, aircraft, and crew traveling to or from that country.\nDue to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Venezuela, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the  Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices . Emergency medical evacuation flights between the United States and Venezuela may not be possible.\nMaritime Travel: \nMariners should not travel to Venezuela.

Your passport must be valid for six months beyond your planned stay, and you must have at least one blank visa page (not including the endorsement page). You will be denied entry to Vietnam if you do not meet these passport and visa requirements. Visit  Mission Vietnam’s website  for the most current information. The U.S. Mission to Vietnam cannot assist U.S. citizens who arrive in Vietnam without required documents. U.S.-Vietnam dual nationals should consult the Department of State’s information page for  Travelers with Dual Nationality  and the  Embassy of Vietnam  for travel requirements. You must enter and exit Vietnam on the same passport. If using a Vietnamese passport to enter and exit the country, your passport must have at least six months’ validity from your return date to the United States.\nVisas:  Travelers can apply for visas through Vietnamese Embassies or Consulates, or online via the  Government of Vietnam’s electronic visa (E-visa) interface . The Government of Vietnam requires a “visa sponsor” for all visa categories, except for E-visas. A visa sponsor is a local business or travel agent to apply for a pre-approval letter with a Vietnamese Immigration Office in Vietnam on behalf of the traveler. Only on receipt of the pre-approval letter can a foreigner apply for an appropriate visa at a Vietnamese Embassy or Consulate abroad, or for a visa on arrival. For more information about this process, please visit the website of the Vietnamese Embassy  here . When you apply for a visa to enter Vietnam, be sure to request the visa category that corresponds to your purpose of travel.\nSpecial Note Regarding E-visas:  U.S. citizens can apply online for an E-visa on the  Vietnam Immigration website . Applicants may apply for single or multiple entry visas, and the Government of Vietnam does not allow for renewal or extension from within the country.  Immigration officials have been issuing visas valid for only for the period requested on the E-visa application; travelers who change their plans or are delayed in departing the country for any reason will likely incur overstay fines and/or delays in obtaining permission to exit Vietnam. We encourage you to take these facts into account when requesting an E-visa visa and noting your intended length of stay\nE-visa applications are usually processed within three to five working days after the Vietnam Immigration Department receives the completed application and E-visa fee. E-visa holders must present the printed E-visa and valid passport at the port of entry. Prior to your travel with an E-visa to Vietnam, we recommend travelers to carefully check their E-visa to make sure all information is correct, and that you will enter/exit Vietnam through a port of entry that you had selected at the time of application. \nAn error on E-visa, including minor differences between the information on the application and the biographical information on the passport such as typos in names or missing middle names, may result in a denial of entry by immigration authorities. The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General are unable to change the information on your E-visa or help expedite the process as Vietnamese E-visa is under the sole jurisdiction of the Vietnamese government. \nPre-approval for Visa on Arrival:  The Government of Vietnam has authorized some businesses and travel agencies to arrange for pre-approval for a “visa on arrival” at the airport. On receipt of a pre-approval letter, travelers may then travel to Vietnam and apply for a visa upon landing to Vietnam. Please be advised that you should not travel to Vietnam without having been issued a pre-approval letter as it may result in a denial of entry by immigration authorities. To avoid having to rearrange your travel date, please do not make travel arrangement before you receive your pre-approval letter.\nAdditional considerations regarding visas : Please refer to  Vietnam’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website  for information detailing visa categories. If you plan to work in Vietnam, you must obtain a work permit  before  applying for your visa. If you change the purpose of your visit after you have received your visa, you must obtain a new visa outside of Vietnam appropriate for your new activities before beginning those activities. Under local immigration law, employment-based visas are based on a petition from a specific employer, and workers may be unable to switch jobs without securing a new visa. In addition, employers may prevent the departure of contracted employees from Vietnam if they violate contract terms. Before accepting employment in Vietnam, make sure you understand the conditions of contracts and employment-based visas.\nNote that travelers with a U.S. APEC Business Travel Card will still need a valid visa to enter Vietnam. The United States is a transitional member of APEC and does not reciprocate with other economies regarding full pre-clearance benefits to applicants. As such, no countries are listed on the back of U.S. APEC Business Travel Cards and card holders are required to present any travel or identity documentation, such as a passport and visa (where applicable), required by Vietnam. If a  U.S. APEC Business Travel Card  holder does not conform to Vietnam’s entry requirements, the card holder may be refused entry.\nPlease consult  Mission Vietnam’s website  for more information.\nPlease note that Vietnam requires a valid visa, residence card, or approval from the Immigration Department to leave the country. Immigration officials will apply a fee to replace lost/stolen visas or will assess a fine for any visa overstays. The Government of Vietnam has recently increased penalties and enforcement of visa overstays, including substantial fines and significant processing times for required exit visas – one to two weeks, and longer for more complex cases). In addition, hotels and other lodging establishments may refuse to host foreigners who have overstayed their visa due to potential fines and sanctions from the Government of Vietnam.\nIf your U.S. passport is lost or stolen in Vietnam, you will need both a replacement passport and a replacement Vietnamese visa to legally remain in or depart Vietnam. The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City can usually issue you a limited validity replacement passport in as little as one business day for emergency purposes; however, the Vietnamese government requires at least three to five working days to issue a replacement visa. For lost and stolen passports, immigration officials will also request a police report. You must file a report of a lost or stolen passport with the police in the location where the loss or theft of your passport occurred, or authorities may refuse to accept the report. The U.S. Embassy and the Consulate General cannot expedite the replacement of your Vietnamese visa.\nIf you plan to travel from Vietnam to Laos by land, you should request that an adhesive visa be affixed to your passport instead of a detachable one. Lao immigration officials require proof that travelers have departed Vietnam, something that can only be shown with an adhesive visa. Vietnamese officials remove detachable visas from passports when travelers depart Vietnam, leaving travelers with no proof of their Vietnam departure. This situation can result in Lao officials requiring travelers to return to Vietnam.\nCertificate of Visa Exemption:  Vietnamese nationals residing abroad indefinitely, their spouses, and their children may apply for a Certificate of Visa Exemption. The certificate has a maximum validity of five years, during which time the holder can enter Vietnam and stay for up to six months without applying for a visa. More information can be found on the  Vietnam Embassy website . \n \n Travelers with HIV/AIDS:  The U.S. Department of State is unaware of any HIV/AIDS entry restrictions for visitors to or foreign residents of Vietnam. \nImmunization information for travelers can be found on the  Centers for Disease and Control’s website .\nInformation about  dual nationality  or the  prevention of international child abduction  can be found on our website. For further information about customs regulations, please read our  Customs Information page .\nThe Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens overseas always maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness while traveling internationally. Please visit  www.travel.state.gov  for up-to-date information. \n\nMessages regarding weather-related events are posted  here  and on the Embassy/Consulate General  website .  \n\nWhile in Vietnam you are subject to Vietnamese laws. U.S. citizenship will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be arrested, expelled, or imprisoned. You may also be barred from departing Vietnam during a potentially lengthy criminal investigation. Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities, prior to practicing or operating a business. \n\nVietnamese authorities routinely do not provide timely notification of the arrest of a U.S. citizen to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General or approval for consular officials to visit U.S. citizens. The delays for both – particularly for access – can take several weeks. See our  webpage  for further information.  \n\nSmall-scale, peaceful protests occasionally occur in Vietnam’s major cities, but large-scale demonstrations are rare. As in any country, you should avoid large protests, as they can become violent with little or no warning.  \n\nThe Government of Vietnam may not allow or authorize travel to certain areas of the country that are deemed sensitive. Check with local authorities before visiting border areas to see if you need to obtain a travel permit issued by local authorities. U.S. citizens have been detained after traveling in areas close to the Vietnamese borders with the People’s Republic of China, Cambodia, and Laos. These areas are not always marked, and there are no warnings about prohibited travel. \n\nSafety standards in Vietnam are not at the same level as those in the United States and vary greatly from company to company and province to province. This is especially true for fire safety codes. Travelers should be aware that many buildings, including hotels, shops, and restaurants, have limited or no fire safety equipment or emergency exits. Ground and water transportation also lack safety regulations.  \n\nTravelers to Vietnam should have no expectation of privacy and should safeguard all personal documents and electronic devices. Exercise caution when discussing sensitive or proprietary information. \n\nCrime:  Crime in Vietnam is rated high. Exercise vigilance and the same commonsense security precautions you would in any major metropolitan city in the United States.\nViolent crime against foreigners is rare; however, petty crimes, such as theft, bag grabs, and pickpocketing occur regularly, especially in crowded areas and tourist locations. Typically, there is a rise in petty crime during the Christmas and Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday seasons, including during the day and in well-lit areas. Motorcyclists are known to snatch bags, cameras, cell phones, and other valuables from individuals riding or walking on the street.   If you are targeted by thieves, do not resist, and report the incident immediately to local police and to the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi or the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City. Keep a tight hold on bags as you enter and exit vehicles and as you walk around. Hold tightly to cell phones when using them outside and lock and stow phones until you actually need to use them.\nSome U.S. citizens have reported threats of death or physical injury connected to business-related disputes. You should report such threats to local authorities and if you feel unsafe, you should depart the country. \nKeep your passport and other important valuables in your hotel in a safe or another secured location at all times and carry both photo and digital copies of your passport. You should immediately report the loss or theft of your U.S. passport to the local police and the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Consulate General. See section on “Visas” for information on what to do if your passport/visa are lost or stolen. \n \n Sexual Assault:  Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Sexual assault, harassment and rape do occur. To minimize the risk avoid travelling alone, especially at night; remain particularly vigilant in less populous areas; and be careful when dealing with strangers or recent acquaintances. Local authorities may not always respond adequately to reports of sexual violence and harassment. U.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General for assistance and may report the crime to local authorities and to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General. Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum, or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.\nMale violence against women and sexual harassment is often ignored by the police. In areas foreigners frequent, women have reported harassment and assault such as men exposing themselves, asking for sexual favors, and groping. \n\nDrugs:  Recreational drugs available in Vietnam can be extremely dangerous and can result in death. Drugs sold in Vietnam may be fake, synthetic, or laced with toxic ingredients undetectable to the buyer. This includes nitrous oxide balloons widely available in nightlife establishments. You should also avoid purchasing liquor or cigarettes from street vendors or strangers, as the authenticity of the contents cannot be assured.  \n\nVictims of Crime:   Vietnam’s local equivalent of an emergency line is 113. In the event you are a victim of a crime, local police will issue a report of a crime, but generally will only initiate investigations for crimes they determine serious, which do not always equate with U.S. standards. Investigations can take several months or even years to complete. \n \nWhile the overall situation is improving, some police have asked for bribes, ostensibly to support local police efforts or to facilitate investigation of a crime. If you are involved in a situation where a police officer is soliciting money, contact American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General.\nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas . \n \nWe can: \nDomestic Violence:  U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence are encouraged to contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance .  Note that local authorities take a different attitude towards domestic violence cases and are hesitant to get involved in cases involving foreigners. Vietnam has very limited infrastructure to support victims of domestic violence. \n\nTourism:  The tourism industry is unevenly regulated, and safety inspections for equipment and facilities do not commonly occur. Hazardous areas/activities are not always identified with appropriate signage, and staff may not be trained or certified either by the host government or by recognized authorities in the field. In the event of an injury, appropriate medical treatment is typically available only in/near major cities. First responders are generally unable to access areas outside of major cities to provide urgent medical treatment. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties:   You are subject to all Vietnamese laws. If you violate local laws, even unknowingly, you may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Individuals establishing a business or practicing a profession that requires additional permits or licensing should seek information from the competent local authorities prior to practicing or operating a business. Penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking in illegal drugs in Vietnam are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines, or even the death penalty. Police periodically raid nightlife establishments suspected of engaging in the drug trade and during these raids will subject all patrons present to drug testing at the police station. A positive result, regardless of whether drugs were consumed in Vietnam or before entry, may result in criminal charges.\nIn Vietnam, you may be taken in for questioning if you do not have proper ID, such as a passport or a copy of your visa. Driving under the influence of alcohol resulting in a fatal accident could lead to immediate imprisonment. If you break local laws in Vietnam, your U.S. passport  will not  help you avoid arrest or prosecution. Note that the Vietnamese legal system allows for lengthy criminal investigation periods that can lead to prolonged pre-trial detention; some investigations can last years without any explanation.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. You can be  prosecuted in the United States  for engaging in sexual conduct with children or for using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country regardless of the legality of these activities under the host country’s laws.\nArrest Notification in Vietnam:   If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General immediately. The Government of Vietnam regularly fails to notify the Embassy or Consulate General of the arrest of a U.S. citizen in a timely fashion and may delay consular access to prisoners for several weeks. \nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may still be illegal according to local laws. You may also pay fines or forfeit them upon return to the United States. See the  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nGambling:  Gambling is highly regulated by the government and persons or businesses running games or gambling halls are required to be licensed. The Government of Vietnam pursues cases of running or playing in unlicensed games aggressively. There are currently U.S. citizens serving jail sentences of three to five years because of illegal gambling.\nDual Nationality:  Dual nationality is accepted by the Vietnamese government in some, but not all, circumstances. However, dual nationals should be aware that Vietnam recognizes their Vietnamese citizenship as primary before others. In such cases, the U.S. Embassy and Consulate General may be limited in the consular services we are able to provide. Furthermore, authorities may delay or refuse to notify the Embassy or Consulate General when arresting a dual national U.S./ Vietnam citizen. U.S. citizens who also hold Vietnamese citizenship and are currently residing in Vietnam may wish to contact local authorities and/or seek competent legal advice on how local laws may affect their status. For detailed information on Vietnamese nationality law and other legal issues visit the  Embassy of Vietnam website . \nWork Authorization:  The Government of Vietnam maintains strict laws with respect to foreign workers. U.S. citizens planning to work in Vietnam should make sure that they are in full compliance with Vietnamese regulations. Penalties can be severe and include deportation, fines, or detention. Vietnam immigration law allows for companies sponsoring foreign employees to exercise full control over their employees’ visas, including prohibiting their exit from the country if they have any outstanding debts. Authorities will often require authenticated copies of civil documents and academic qualifications to process work visas. This process must take place in the United States through the  Department of State’s Office of Authentications.  The Embassy and Consulate General cannot authenticate U.S.-issued documents.\nTeaching English:  We advise those considering accepting an English teaching job in Vietnam to carefully review the terms of the contract regarding working and living conditions and to ask for multiple references from persons familiar with the institution, especially former U.S. citizen employees, before committing to contracts. Some U.S. citizens have reported their employers have reneged on contract terms, including offering significantly lower salaries than agreed or seizing their passports, and employers have caused complications with the exit visa process for employees who quit, complicating the exit visas required to depart the country. \nHotels:  Hotels in Vietnam require you to present your passport (and visas, if issued separately) upon check-in so that your stay can be registered with local police. Every guest in a hotel room or private residence must be registered, regardless of nationality. If you stay at a private residence (i.e., at the residence of family or friends), you must comply with registration requirements by visiting the local police station and registering your stay within 24 hours. Some provinces allow registration online.\nExports:  Vietnamese law prohibits the export of antiques. However, these laws are vague and unevenly enforced. Customs authorities may inspect and seize your antiques without compensating you, and the determination of what is an “antique” can be arbitrary. If you purchase non-antique items of value, you should retain receipts and confirmation from shop owners and/or the Ministry of Culture and the Customs Department to prevent seizure when you leave the country.\nImports:  Vietnamese authorities have seized documents, audio and video tapes, compact discs, literature, and personal letters they deem to be pornographic or political in nature or intended for religious or political proselytizing. It is illegal to import weapons, ammunition, explosives, military equipment and tools (including uniforms), narcotics, drugs, toxic chemicals, pornographic and subversive materials, firecrackers, or children's toys that have \"negative effects on personality development, social order, and security.\"  \n  \nFor up-to-date information on Vietnam Customs information, please visit the  Vietnam Customs website .\nFreedom of Expression:   The Government of Vietnam maintains strict control over all forms of political speech, particularly dissent or speech it deems as critical of the government and/or party. U.S. citizens have been detained, tried, and convicted for political activities (including criticizing the government or its domestic/foreign policies or advocating alternatives to Communist Party rule), possession of political material, and non-sanctioned religious activities (including proselytizing). Authorities have also detained U.S. citizens for posting messages on blogs or online chatrooms that are perceived to be political or critical of the government. U.S. citizens of Vietnamese descent should be especially careful with their online postings. Review the latest version of the  Vietnam Human Rights Report  for the latest information on Freedom of Expression in Vietnam.\nAssociation with Groups:   Persons whom the Government of Vietnam perceives to be associated with dissident or political groups may be denied entry to Vietnam, prevented from departing, detained, interrogated, placed under surveillance, or even tried and convicted. Note that if arrested, you could be subject to lengthy detention without access to an attorney or family members. U.S. citizens of Vietnamese descent should be especially careful about associating with dissident groups. U.S. citizen travelers have been summoned by immigration or local security officials for reasons that are unclear or not explicitly related to any suspected or alleged violation of law. We recommend that U.S. citizens finding themselves in this situation contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General immediately for further information and/or assistance.\nPhotography:  Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in questioning by authorities, fines, or delayed travel. You should be cautious when traveling near military bases and avoid photography in these areas. \n  \n Disputes:  The Vietnamese government has occasionally seized the passports and blocked the departure of foreigners involved in commercial disputes. U.S. citizens whose passports have been seized by Vietnamese authorities should contact the Embassy or Consulate General for assistance . \nCivil Procedures:  Civil procedures in Vietnam, such as marriage, divorce, documenting the birth of a child, and issuance of death certificates, are highly bureaucratic and can be slow. Local authorities may refuse a request to include a non-Vietnamese name on a birth certificate. In addition, for those wishing to get married in Vietnam, you will need a notarized affidavit of single status. Please contact the  Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, D.C. , or the  Vietnamese Consulate General in San Francisco  or  Houston  concerning documentary requirements for these services. Authorities will often require authenticated copies of civil documents and academic qualifications for various functions. The Embassy and Consulate General cannot authenticate U.S.-issued documents. See the  Department of State’s Office of Authentications  for additional information about the authentication process.\nEnforcement of civil orders is frequently difficult or non-existent. \nWomen Travelers:   See our travel tips for  Women Travelers . \nLGB Rights:  There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or in attending LGB events in Vietnam. See   our page and section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nAccessibility:  Most public places and public transportation are  not  accessible to persons with disabilities. Sidewalks, curb ramps, restrooms, road crossings, and tourist areas are not equipped to assist such individuals. New, modern buildings and facilities in larger urban cities are regularly built with ramps and accessible entryways. \nStudents:  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .\nMedical facilities in Vietnam, including emergency response services, frequently do not meet international standards and may lack medicine and supplies. We strongly recommend travelers purchase medical evacuation insurance before visiting Vietnam. \n\nWe do not pay medical bills.  The U.S. government cannot pay medical bills and does not provide medical assistance. Also, be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas. \n\nMedical Insurance:  Make sure your health insurance plan provides coverage overseas. Most care providers overseas only accept upfront payments. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage . Visit the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  for more information on type of insurance you should consider before you travel overseas. If covered by TriCare, check the TriCare website ( https://www.tricare.mil/ ) for additional information about overseas coverage. \nWe strongly recommend supplemental insurance to cover medical evacuation as it can cost many thousands of dollars. Always carry your prescription medication in original packaging, along with your doctor’s prescription. \n\nIt is extremely important  that travelers have sufficient funds and/or insurance to cover any potential medical costs. Frequently hospitals will hold onto a patient’s passport as collateral for payment, and patients may have difficulty getting their passport back without paying their medical bills in full. Patients who do not pay their medical bills in full also run the risk of being barred from departing the country. \n\nVaccinations:  Be up-to-date on all  vaccinations  recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \n\nAir quality:  Air pollution is a significant problem in Vietnam’s major cities, and you should consult your doctor prior to travel and consider the impact that seasonal smog and heavy particulate pollution may have on you. To obtain information on the air quality in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, please follow the link to the Environmental Protection Agency’s  AirNow website . Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City’s Air Quality Index (AQI) can be observed through “City” option on the upper right part of the page. The page provides AQI over the last 24-hour period as well as pollutant concentration and a downloadable historical document.\nRoad Conditions and Safety:  Traffic in Vietnam is dangerous, chaotic, and undisciplined. Road conditions are poor; traffic accidents are the leading cause of death, severe injury, and emergency evacuation of foreigners in Vietnam. Long-distance buses and trains do not meet U.S. safety standards. Buses and trucks are often overloaded and travel at high speeds with little regard to other modes of road transportation. \n\nTraffic Laws:  Driving in Vietnam is not comparable to driving in other countries. Vietnamese drivers routinely ignore traffic laws, causing traffic fatalities on a daily basis. We strongly discourage you from operating a motorcycle or scooter in Vietnam. Vietnamese drivers and pedestrians may not behave in a manner to which Americans are accustomed. If you do choose to operate a motorcycle or scooter in Vietnam, wear a helmet and  always  yield to larger vehicles. Motor bike fatalities are a leading cause of death or serious injury among foreign nationals visiting or living in Vietnam, with several fatalities having occurred on major roads and rural routes within the past year. If you are the victim of a serious motor bike accident in Vietnam, the prognosis for full recovery and survival is low due to Vietnam’s poor medical infrastructure. A motorbike license is required to operate a motorcycle or scooter in Vietnam. Motor scooter drivers without a license can be held criminally liable for injuries to or death of a victim in an accident, and you may be held in custody for an extended period of time without the ability to speak to family or a lawyer during the investigation. \n\nPedestrians should always look carefully  in both directions  before crossing streets, even when using a marked crosswalk with a green “walk” light illuminated or when crossing what is believed to be a one-way street. When walking on sidewalks, be mindful of scooters that may be behind you. Vietnamese commonly drive their scooters against traffic and on sidewalks. \n\nBecause the United States is not a party to the Convention on Road Traffic, international driving permits and U.S. drivers’ licenses are  not valid  in Vietnam. Foreigners renting vehicles risk fines, prosecution, and/or imprisonment for driving without a Vietnamese license endorsed for the appropriate vehicle. If you wish to drive in Vietnam, contact the Provincial Public Transportation Service of the Vietnamese Department of Communications and Transport to obtain a Vietnamese driver’s license. Note that you may be required to take a medical examination as part of the driver license application process. \n\nFor more information, please refer to Vietnam’s national tourism office website. \n\nPublic Transportation: \n\nBus System:  While Vietnam does have an extensive bus system, buses can be overcrowded and are often driven with little or no regard for passenger safety. \n\nFor-hire vehicles:  Major taxi companies tend to be reliable. Occasionally boutique taxi companies have rigged meters, particularly on routes to and from the international airports. Exercise caution in choosing ground transportation upon arrival at the airport in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. Some travelers have reported being robbed by drivers who greeted them upon arrival with a placard showing the traveler's name. If you are expecting to be picked up, ask the company for the driver’s name, phone number, and license plate number before you travel. Areas outside of large cities typically have only rudimentary public transportation and often do not have metered taxis. Travelers are advised to use caution in these situations. \n\nWe strongly discourage the use of motorcycle taxis (known as “xe om”). Motorcycle taxis are unregulated and unsafe, and the helmets provided to riders offer little to no protection against injury in the case of an accident. \n\nSmartphone-based for-hire vehicle services:  GrabTaxi and local taxi companies are readily available, accessible via Smartphone apps, and routinely utilized by foreigners and locals.  \n\nAviation Safety Oversight:  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the government of Vietnam’s Civil Aviation Authority as being in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards for oversight of Vietnam’s air carrier operations. Further information may be found on the  FAA’s safety assessment page . \n\nMaritime Travel:  Mariners planning travel to Vietnam should also check for  U.S. maritime  advisories  and alerts . Information may also be posted to the  U.S. Coast Guard homeport website , and the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) broadcast warnings website  portal."

    "advisory_text": "The  U.S. Embassy in Sana’a  suspended operations on February 11, 2015, and therefore cannot provide consular services in Yemen.  The U.S. government has extremely limited capabilities to assist U.S. citizens in Yemen.\nThe U.S. Department of State strongly recommends that U.S. citizens avoid travel to Yemen due to the very high risk of kidnapping and detention.  U.S. citizens in Yemen are strongly recommended to depart the country.  U.S. citizens, including dual nationals, have faced difficulty – including lengthy delays – when attempting to depart Yemen. More information can be found in our  Yemen Travel Advisory.\nPlease direct inquiries regarding U.S. citizens in Yemen to  YemenEmergencyUSC@state.gov . Callers in the U.S. and Canada may dial the toll-free number 1-888-407-4747. Callers outside the United States and Canada may dial 1-202-501-4444.\nSee the Department of State’s Fact Sheet on  Yemen  for information on U.S.-Yemen relations. \nThe U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the high security threat level in Yemen due to terrorism, kidnappings, detentions, civil unrest, armed conflict and landmines. The Department urges U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Yemen and urges U.S. citizens currently in Yemen to depart.  \nAll visitors to Yemen are required to obtain a visa prior to travel to Yemen.  U.S. citizens typically are issued visas that are valid for 30 days. At the time of publication, the Embassy of Yemen in Washington, D.C. is not issuing tourist visas. For the most current and complete visa information, visit the  Embassy of Yemen's website  or call the Embassy of Yemen in Washington, D.C. at (202) 965-4760 ext. 2.\nYemen has imposed HIV/AIDS travel restrictions on anyone with a known HIV infection. One requirement to obtain an entry visa to Yemen is a medical certificate issued by an authorized official body confirming you are free from infectious diseases.  Please verify this information with the  Embassy of  Yemen .\nFind information on  dual nationality ,  prevention of international child abduction , and  customs regulations  on our websites.\nIf you are in Yemen and have questions about your federal benefits, please contact  FBU.Jerusalem@SSA.gov .\nTerrorism : Terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them want to attack American citizens outside of the United States. They are using simpler methods of attack like knives, guns, and vehicles to target crowds. They often go after unprotected or vulnerable targets.\nFor more information, see our  Terrorism  page.\nSince September 2014, the Houthis, who control Sana’a and other areas of northern Yemen, have detained U.S. citizens, including those with dual Yemeni-U.S. citizenship. Reports say that U.S. citizens are targeted just because they are U.S. citizens. It does not matter how long they have been in Yemen or if they have connections with rebel groups, local businesses, or humanitarian organizations.\nDuring their detention, which can last for years, U.S. citizens are not allowed to contact their families. They also cannot receive visits from U.S. consular personnel or international humanitarian organizations. The U.S. government has very limited ability to help U.S. citizens in detention. There has been no U.S. diplomatic presence in Yemen since the Houthis took over Sana’a.\nIn addition to the risk of detention by rebel groups, U.S. citizens in Yemen face other dangers. These include ongoing conflict, terrorist activity, and kidnappings for ransom. Violence, armed conflict, and artillery shelling continue in many areas of the country. Yemen remains very unstable and dangerous.\nShips in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Aden should be on high alert. Tensions in the region increase the risk of damage to ships from missiles, projectiles, or waterborne explosive devices. Piracy is also a threat in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean. There have been many pirate attacks in waters near Yemen in recent years. The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) warns that regional tensions have increased the risk of maritime attacks by extremists in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Bab al-Mandeb.\nMARAD recommends vessels at anchor, operating in restricted maneuvering environments, or at slow speeds should be especially vigilant and report suspicious activity. U.S. flag vessels that observe suspicious activity in the area are advised to report such suspicious activity or any hostile or potentially hostile action to COMUSNAVCENT battlewatch captain at phone number 011-973-1785-3879. All suspicious activities and events are also to be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802, 202-267-2675, or TDD 202-267-4477. For further information, see the Department of State’s  International Maritime Piracy Fact Sheet  and the  United States Maritime Administration (MARAD)  advisory on vessels transiting high risk waters.\nLandmines and unexploded ordnance also pose a risk. This is of particular concern in the six southern provinces and in the northern highlands.\nPlease note that the local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Yemen is 199, but operators do not speak English.\nCrime : Due to the ongoing civil unrest and weak government institutions, travelers should not rely on assistance from local authorities.  Foreigners are frequently the target of kidnapping and carjacking, particularly when traveling outside of urban areas.\nScams : Internet romance and financial scams are prevalent in Yemen.  Review the  Department of State’s Protecting Yourself from Scams  and the  FBI  pages for information. \nTechnology Usage Abroad:  Mobile devices can be compromised, stolen, or damaged anywhere in the world. Before traveling abroad, it is best to keep all software (operating system and apps) updated. If possible, use a virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to unknown open Wi-Fi.\nGPS Navigation Apps are helpful in getting U.S. citizens around in a foreign country. Prior to using the GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without safety consideration.\nBe careful when using dating apps or online dating websites while abroad. Scammers may target U.S. citizens. Tell your friends and family where you are, meet in a popular public place, and avoid consuming suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\nVictims of Crime : The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.  Report crimes to the local police at 199.  As there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, you should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country for services.  \nSee our webpage on  help for U.S. victims of crime overseas .\nDomestic Violence :  The law in Yemen protects against domestic violence under general prohibitions of violence, but authorities do not enforce this provision effectively. The law criminalizes rape, but not spousal rape. Authorities may prosecute rape survivors on charges of fornication if the perpetrator is not charged with rape. According to law, without the perpetrator’s confession, the rape survivor must provide four male witnesses to the crime.\nThe law allows leniency for persons found guilty of committing an “honor” killing or violently assaulting or killing a woman for perceived “immodest” or “defiant” behavior. The law does not address other types of gender-based abuse, such as forced isolation, imprisonment, and early or forced marriage.\nSee Section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  for additional information.\nAs there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen at this time, U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should coordinate with a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country. The U.S. government is extremely limited in the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.\nTourism :  No formal tourism industry infrastructure is in place in Yemen on any level. Tourists are considered to be participating in activities at their own risk. Emergency response and subsequent appropriate medical treatment is not available in-country. U.S. citizens are encouraged to purchase medical evacuation insurance. See our webpage for more  information on insurance providers for overseas coverage .\nCriminal Penalties : You are subject to local laws. If you break local laws, even if you don't know it, you can be kicked out of the area, arrested, or put in prison. If you want to start a business or work in a job that needs special permits or licenses, you should get information from the local authorities before you start.\nIn Yemen, the law may be applied inconsistently, and foreign travelers may be taken in for questioning if they do not have their passport with them. Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs can land the driver immediately in jail. The criminal penalties in Yemen may be very different from what U.S. citizens are accustomed to in the United States.\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on  crimes against minors abroad  and the  Department of Justice  website.\nArrest Notification : The U.S. government is extremely limited to the consular assistance it can provide in Yemen.  The U.S. Department of State has designated the U.S. Embassies in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Djibouti, and Cairo, Egypt, to handle American Citizens Services cases emanating out of Yemen. If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy in one of these locations immediately.  See our  webpage  for further information.\nSpecial Circumstances : Photographing military installations, including airports, equipment, or troops is forbidden.  Such photography has led to the arrest of U.S. citizens.  Military sites are not always obvious.  If in doubt, ask specific permission from Yemeni authorities.\nU.S. citizens who travel to Yemen are subject to the jurisdiction of Yemeni courts, as well as to the country's laws, customs, and regulations. This holds true for all legal matters, including child custody and travel restrictions.\nThe U.S. Department of State cannot intervene in custody matters, and parents must work through the local courts.  Women in custody disputes in Yemen will not enjoy the same rights that they do in the United States, as Yemeni law often does not work in favor of the mother.  U.S. custody orders might not be enforced in Yemen.\nU.S. citizen girls and women who travel to Yemen are at risk of being forced into marriage and may be vulnerable to other forms of gender-based restrictions and violence, particularly in Houthi-controlled areas.  U.S. citizen women who are married to Yemeni or Yemeni-American men should be aware that their children may not be able to depart if the children are brought to Yemen.  In many instances, women must obtain permission from their husbands to obtain an exit visa.  They also may not be able to take their children out of Yemen without the permission of the father, regardless of who has legal custody.  U.S. divorce decrees may not be recognized in Yemen, especially if the marriage took place in Yemen.  In some cases, U.S. citizen women who have married in Yemen and divorced in the United States have been prevented from departing Yemen by their ex-husbands.\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods:  Counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries. They may be illegal according to local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection website  and  U.S. Department of Justice website  for more information.\nFaith-Based Travelers : The law prohibits denunciation of Islam, conversion from Islam to another religion, and proselytizing directed at Muslims.  Religious minorities face persecution, including detention, as a result of their religious beliefs, particularly in Houthi-controlled areas.\nSee the following webpages for details:\nLGB Travelers : Consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized in Yemen as is gender expression that does not conform with a person’s assigned sex at birth.  Penalties include fines, jail time, or death.\nSee our  LGB Travel Information  page and Section 6 of our  Human Rights report  for further details.\nTravelers with Disabilities : The law in Yemen prohibits discrimination against persons with physical, intellectual or mental disabilities, but the law is not enforced. Social acceptance of persons with disabilities in public may not be as prevalent as in the United States.  Expect accessibility to be limited in public transportation, lodging, communication/information, and general infrastructure.\nSee our  Travelers with Disabilities  page.\nStudents :  See our  Students Abroad  page and  FBI travel tips .  \nWomen Travelers : See our travel tips for  Women Travelers .\nWomen face deeply entrenched discrimination. Women cannot marry without the permission of their male guardians; do not have equal rights in inheritance, divorce, or child custody; and have little legal protection. They experience discrimination in employment, credit, pay, owning or managing businesses, education, and housing.  A male relative’s consent is often required before a woman can be admitted to a hospital.\nWomen traveling in areas under Houthi control may be required to be escorted by a male guardian who is a relative.\nSee Section 6 of our  Human Rights Report  and the Special Circumstances section above for more information.\nFor emergency services in Yemen, dial 199.  Please note that operators are not likely to speak English.\nAmbulance services are not present throughout the country or are unreliable in most areas.\nSee our  Health Abroad  page for more information.\nThe Department of State, U.S. embassies and U.S. consulates do not pay medical bills.  Be aware that U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.
